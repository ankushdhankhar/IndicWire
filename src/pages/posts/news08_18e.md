**J-K Polls: Resolution Against Article 370 ‘First Order Of Business’, Says Omar Abdullah**

**Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir** – Omar Abdullah, the Vice President of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (NC), has made a bold declaration ahead of the much-anticipated Jammu and Kashmir (J-K) assembly elections. He announced that the restoration of Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state, would be the "first order of business" for his party if it wins the upcoming polls.

In a press conference held in Srinagar, Abdullah criticized the Central government's decision to abrogate Article 370 on August 5, 2019. He reiterated that the move, which bifurcated the state into two Union Territories—Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh—was unconstitutional and done without the consent of the people of J-K. Abdullah emphasized that the restoration of Article 370 is not just a political agenda but a matter of “justice, dignity, and constitutional rights” for the people of the region.

**Commitment to Reversing the Abrogation**

Omar Abdullah’s statement underscores the National Conference's commitment to reversing the abrogation. "The people of Jammu and Kashmir have been disempowered, and their rights trampled upon by the unconstitutional abrogation of Article 370. Restoring it will be our first order of business when we come to power," he asserted.

The former Chief Minister also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of using J-K's political instability for electoral gains across the rest of India. He warned that the decision to abrogate Article 370 had led to widespread alienation and unrest in the region, and the NC would work tirelessly to bring back normalcy by restoring its special status.

**Election Strategy and Alliance Building**

In addition to focusing on Article 370, Abdullah outlined his party's broader election strategy, which includes addressing unemployment, development, and security issues in the region. He indicated that the NC is open to alliances with other regional parties, including the People's Democratic Party (PDP), to present a united front against the BJP and its allies.

Abdullah also hinted at the possibility of forming a coalition government if no single party wins a clear majority. He stressed that the unity of regional parties is crucial to safeguarding the interests of Jammu and Kashmir and resisting what he described as the "divisive and authoritarian policies" of the central government.

**Reactions from Political Rivals**

Abdullah’s announcement has already sparked reactions from political rivals. The BJP, which is also gearing up for the J-K polls, dismissed the NC's agenda as "regressive" and "anti-national." BJP spokespersons argued that Article 370 was an impediment to the region's development and integration with the rest of India, and its abrogation has brought about positive changes in the Union Territory.

On the other hand, Mehbooba Mufti, leader of the PDP, supported Abdullah’s stance, reiterating her party's long-standing demand for the restoration of Article 370. Mufti also called for a broader alliance of like-minded parties to challenge the BJP’s influence in J-K.

**Public Sentiment and Electoral Landscape**

The upcoming elections in J-K are being closely watched as they will be the first since the abrogation of Article 370. The political landscape is highly polarized, with the NC and PDP rallying for the restoration of special status, while the BJP is campaigning on the promise of development and stability.

Public sentiment in the region remains divided, with a significant portion of the population feeling betrayed by the abrogation, while others see it as an opportunity for economic growth and integration with the rest of the country. The election results will likely hinge on voter turnout, especially in the Kashmir Valley, where pro-Article 370 sentiments are strongest.

**Conclusion**

Omar Abdullah's pledge to make the restoration of Article 370 the top priority of the National Conference signals a high-stakes political battle in the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir elections. As the region gears up for its first polls since the landmark constitutional change, the outcome will not only shape the future of Jammu and Kashmir but could also have far-reaching implications for the rest of India.
