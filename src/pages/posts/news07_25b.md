**US State Department Updates Travel Advisory for India: Several Regions Classified as "Do Not Travel"**

*Washington D.C., July 25, 2024* â€” The U.S. State Department has updated its travel advisory for India, placing several regions under a Level 4: "Do Not Travel" classification due to heightened risks of crime, terrorism, and violence. This advisory comes as part of the Department's regular assessment of global safety conditions for American travelers.

### Affected Regions

**1. Jammu and Kashmir:**  
The long-standing conflict in Jammu and Kashmir continues to pose significant risks. The region has seen persistent insurgent activity, occasional skirmishes along the Line of Control, and frequent security lockdowns. The U.S. government strongly advises against travel to this area due to ongoing security concerns.

**2. India-Pakistan Border:**  
The border areas between India and Pakistan remain highly volatile. The advisory specifically highlights the potential for armed conflict and landmine hazards in these regions. Travelers are warned to stay well clear of the border, especially within 10 kilometers of the line of control.

**3. Manipur:**  
The northeastern state of Manipur has been plagued by insurgent activities and ethnic violence. Recent clashes and militant attacks have further destabilized the region, prompting the State Department to classify it as high-risk for travelers.

**4. Central and Eastern India:**  
Parts of central and eastern India, including the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha, face significant threats from Naxalite-Maoist insurgents. These groups frequently engage in violent activities, including bombings and ambushes targeting security forces and civilians.

### Advisory Details

The travel advisory emphasizes the following key points:

- **Exercise Increased Caution:** Travelers are urged to exercise increased caution throughout India, even in regions not classified as Level 4. Areas with lower risk levels may still experience periodic security incidents.
- **Monitor Local Media:** Visitors are advised to stay informed through local news sources and follow the instructions of local authorities. Situational awareness is critical, especially in crowded places and tourist areas.
- **Enroll in STEP:** The State Department recommends that U.S. citizens traveling to or residing in India enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts and make it easier to locate them in an emergency.
- **Avoid Public Demonstrations:** Demonstrations can occur with little notice and have the potential to turn violent. It is advisable to avoid large gatherings and follow local guidance.

### Response from Indian Authorities

In response to the updated advisory, Indian officials have assured that measures are being taken to enhance security and protect tourists. The Ministry of Home Affairs reiterated its commitment to maintaining law and order, particularly in regions popular with international visitors.

### Conclusion

While India remains a popular destination for American tourists, the U.S. State Department's advisory underscores the importance of vigilance and caution. Travelers are encouraged to plan their trips carefully, avoiding high-risk areas and staying informed about the latest security developments.
