**Controversy Surrounds Atishi's Appointment as Delhi Chief Minister Amid Allegations of Family's Support for Afzal Guru**

**New Delhi:** Atishi, the newly appointed Chief Minister of Delhi, has found herself at the center of a political storm following allegations regarding her family's controversial stance on the execution of convicted terrorist Afzal Guru. Critics have raised questions about her suitability for office, highlighting her parents' long-standing opposition to Guru’s death sentence.

Afzal Guru, convicted for his involvement in the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, was hanged in 2013 after a lengthy legal battle. However, Atishi’s family, known for their left-leaning activism, reportedly campaigned against his execution, believing that Guru was innocent and a victim of a political conspiracy. According to critics, her parents, prominent educationists, wrote multiple mercy petitions to the President of India, pleading for clemency on Guru's behalf.

### Opposition Reacts Strongly
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other opposition parties have condemned Atishi’s appointment, calling it a betrayal of national security and a mockery of the sacrifices made during the 2001 Parliament attack. "It is shameful that someone whose family fought to save a terrorist is now heading the capital of India," a senior BJP leader remarked.

The controversy has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many users expressing outrage over the issue. Hashtags such as #ShameOnDelhiCM and #AfzalGuruSympathizer have trended, reflecting public discontent. Some have also questioned the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) decision to elevate Atishi to the role of Chief Minister, accusing the party of being insensitive to the memory of the victims of the Parliament attack.

### Defending Her Legacy
In response to these allegations, Atishi has distanced herself from the views expressed by her family. In a recent press conference, she stated, “I have always upheld the law and the Constitution of India. The actions and beliefs of my family should not be used to question my integrity or my dedication to the welfare of the people of Delhi.”

Atishi’s supporters have rallied behind her, emphasizing her achievements as an education reformer and her contribution to improving Delhi’s public education system. They argue that her family’s past activism should not overshadow her capabilities as a leader.

### A Divisive Issue
Despite Atishi’s defense, the issue has continued to polarize political circles. Many Delhi citizens are now questioning whether her appointment will affect the city’s governance, while others express concern that such a controversy could undermine trust in the state's leadership.

As the controversy unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Atishi can overcome these allegations and focus on her governance agenda or if her tenure will be overshadowed by the political storm surrounding her family’s past.
