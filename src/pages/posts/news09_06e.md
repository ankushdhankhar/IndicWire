### **Jio and Airtel Implement Restrictions on 5G Network Sharing: Users Report Throttling of Data Speeds via Hotspot**

**New Delhi** – As India continues to embrace the 5G revolution, users of two of the country’s largest telecom operators, Jio and Airtel, have reported significant restrictions when sharing their 5G network with other devices. These restrictions have resulted in a noticeable drop in data speeds when using hotspot or tethering features, raising questions about the true potential of 5G in daily usage scenarios.

### **User Experiences: Promises vs. Reality**

The promise of 5G has been one of unprecedented speed, low latency, and the ability to connect multiple devices without compromising performance. However, recent experiences by users of Jio and Airtel suggest that this promise comes with certain caveats.

“I was excited to try out the 5G network on my new smartphone and expected blazing fast speeds,” said Rahul Gupta, a resident of Mumbai. “But as soon as I tried to share the connection with my laptop via hotspot, the speed dropped drastically. It was almost as if I was back on 4G.”

Similar stories have emerged from users across the country, leading to widespread speculation about the underlying reasons for this throttling.

### **Understanding the Throttling Mechanism**

Telecom experts point out that the throttling of data speeds during hotspot usage is likely a deliberate move by the operators to manage network resources and ensure fair usage. Here are some potential reasons behind this approach:

1. **Network Management and Fair Usage Policies**:  
   Both Jio and Airtel have millions of subscribers. To maintain network stability and prevent congestion, operators may implement fair usage policies that restrict data speeds when the connection is shared with multiple devices. This helps ensure that all users have a consistent experience, even during peak hours.

2. **Service Plan Restrictions**:  
   Certain 5G plans offered by Jio and Airtel may come with explicit terms that limit the speed or amount of data available for hotspot use. This is a common practice among telecom operators globally, designed to prevent excessive use of network resources by a single user.

3. **Technical and Device Limitations**:  
   While 5G networks are capable of delivering extremely high speeds, the devices used to share the connection may not be fully optimized for such tasks. Factors such as the device’s hardware, software, and even the number of connected devices can influence the overall performance of the hotspot.

### **Official Responses: Maintaining Network Integrity**

When approached for comment, representatives from both Jio and Airtel emphasized their commitment to providing the best possible 5G experience to all users. However, they acknowledged that certain restrictions are necessary to maintain the integrity of the network.

“5G is a transformative technology, but with great power comes the responsibility to manage resources effectively,” said a spokesperson from Jio. “We are continuously monitoring network usage and may implement measures such as speed throttling during hotspot use to ensure that all users can enjoy a seamless 5G experience.”

Airtel echoed similar sentiments, stating, “Our priority is to deliver high-quality service across the board. While we encourage users to explore the capabilities of 5G, we also need to ensure that the network remains stable and accessible to everyone. Speed management during hotspot usage is one way to achieve this balance.”
