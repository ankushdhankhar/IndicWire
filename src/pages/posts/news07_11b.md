### Student Deported from UAE After Shouting "Free Palestine" at Graduation Ceremony

**Abu Dhabi, UAE – July 11, 2024** – A student who attended the graduation ceremony at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) has been deported from the United Arab Emirates after shouting "Free Palestine" as he walked across the stage to receive his diploma. The incident has sparked a significant discussion about free speech and political expression in the UAE.

**Incident Details**

The student, who was wearing a black-and-white scarf, made the statement as he collected his degree. The act was immediately met with mixed reactions from the audience, with some applauding and others remaining silent. NYUAD officials swiftly intervened and escorted the student off the stage. The identity of the student has not been disclosed by the university.

**Official Response**

In a statement released by the UAE government, authorities confirmed that the student, along with several others who were allegedly involved in organizing the protest, were deported. "The UAE upholds the values of respect and harmony within its diverse community. Actions that disrupt public order and harmony will not be tolerated," the statement read.

NYUAD also issued a statement expressing regret over the incident, emphasizing that while the university supports the free exchange of ideas, it also respects the laws and regulations of the host country. "NYUAD is committed to providing a platform for intellectual and personal growth within the boundaries of respect and legal frameworks," the statement said.

**Reactions and Implications**

The deportation has drawn international attention, with human rights organizations and activists condemning the UAE's actions as a violation of free speech. "The right to express one's political views is fundamental. The UAE's decision to deport the student is a severe response that undermines this right," said a spokesperson from Human Rights Watch.

Social media has seen a flurry of responses, with many users expressing solidarity with the student. Hashtags such as #FreePalestine and #SupportFreeSpeech have been trending on various platforms.

On the other hand, some voices within the UAE and its supporters have defended the decision, arguing that public demonstrations of this nature can lead to unrest and must be managed appropriately to maintain public order.

**Conclusion**

The deportation of the NYUAD student following his "Free Palestine" statement at the graduation ceremony underscores the delicate balance between free speech and public order in the UAE. As international scrutiny grows, the incident highlights the broader conversation about political expression in regions with stringent regulations. The student's future remains uncertain, and it is unclear if further actions will be taken by either the UAE government or international human rights bodies.
