## India Protests Germany's Remarks on Arvind Kejriwal's Arrest as "Blatant Interference"

**New Delhi, March 23, 2024** — The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has lodged a **strong protest** with the German envoy following the country's comments on the arrest of Delhi Chief Minister **Arvind Kejriwal** by the Enforcement Directorate. The German Deputy Head of Mission, **George Enzweiler**, was summoned to address the matter.

Germany's foreign affairs spokesperson had expressed hope that the "standards relating to the independence of the judiciary and basic democratic principles" would be upheld in Kejriwal's case. However, India construed this statement as **"blatant interference"** in its internal affairs .

Arvind Kejriwal, who was arrested in connection with a money laundering probe linked to the Delhi liquor policy case, has been remanded to ED custody until March 28. The spokesperson of the German Foreign Ministry emphasized that the **presumption of innocence** is a central element of the rule of law and must apply to Kejriwal. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced plans to "gherao" Prime Minister Narendra Modi's house on March 26 in protest of Kejriwal's arrest by the Enforcement Directorate.

India maintains that Kejriwal's arrest is an **internal matter**, and any biased assumptions from foreign nations are unwarranted. The MEA expects that **principles related to judicial independence and democratic norms** will be upheld in this case.
