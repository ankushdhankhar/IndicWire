**Australia Doubles Visa Fee for International Students Amid Housing Crisis**

**Canberra, July 1, 2024** – In a significant policy shift, the Australian government announced on Monday that it has more than doubled the visa fee for international students. This measure is part of a broader strategy to address the country's record migration levels, which have been exacerbating pressures on an already tight housing market.

Effective from today, the cost of an international student visa has increased to A$1,600 (US$1,068), up from A$710. This substantial hike is expected to impact thousands of prospective international students planning to study in Australia.

In addition to the fee increase, the government has imposed new restrictions on visa applications. Visitors and students holding temporary graduate visas are now prohibited from applying for a student visa while onshore. This move aims to reduce the number of individuals transitioning from temporary to more permanent forms of residency, a trend that has contributed to the surge in migration numbers.

Australia has long been a popular destination for international students, offering high-quality education and post-study work opportunities. However, the influx of international students and other migrants has placed significant strain on the housing market, leading to soaring rental prices and a shortage of affordable housing.

The government’s decision has sparked a range of reactions. Education providers and industry experts warn that the increased fees could deter international students, potentially impacting the country's education sector, which relies heavily on the revenue generated from international enrolments.

“The fee hike is likely to make Australia a less attractive destination for international students, who might opt for other countries with more affordable visa processes,” said Dr. Sarah Langley, an education policy analyst. “This could have long-term implications for our universities and the broader economy.”

On the other hand, some housing advocates have welcomed the move, arguing that it is a necessary step to alleviate the housing crisis. “Reducing the number of new migrants can help ease the demand for housing and potentially stabilize rental prices,” said James Turner, a spokesperson for Affordable Housing Australia.

The government maintains that the new measures are essential to manage migration levels and address the housing shortage. In a statement, Immigration Minister Alex Hawke emphasized the need for balanced and sustainable migration policies that benefit both the economy and the community.

As Australia navigates these complex challenges, the impact of the increased visa fees and new restrictions will be closely monitored by stakeholders across the education and housing sectors.
