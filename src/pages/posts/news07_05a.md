**Family of Agniveer Ajay Kumar Demands 'Hero' Status and Pension Benefits**

**Patna, Bihar:** The family of Agniveer Ajay Kumar, who tragically lost his life in the line of duty, has called for the Indian Army to honor him with the 'hero' status. Ajay Kumar, a dedicated soldier, died while serving the nation, leaving behind grieving family members who feel that monetary compensation alone cannot replace the loss of their beloved son.

In a heartfelt plea, Ajay Kumar's father expressed the family's desire for the scrapping of the Agniveer scheme. "We want the Agniveer scheme to be scrapped and we should get pension and canteen card," he stated. The family believes that the current scheme does not adequately address the long-term welfare and recognition of soldiers who make the ultimate sacrifice for their country.

Ajay Kumar, who hailed from a modest background, joined the Indian Army with a dream to serve the nation and bring pride to his family. His untimely death has not only left a void in the hearts of his loved ones but also raised questions about the support provided to the families of fallen soldiers under the Agniveer scheme.

The Agniveer scheme, introduced to streamline the recruitment process and provide young individuals with an opportunity to serve in the armed forces, has faced criticism for its lack of long-term benefits for soldiers and their families. The family of Ajay Kumar is now urging the government to reconsider the provisions of the scheme and ensure that the sacrifices of soldiers are duly recognized and honored.

The demand for 'hero' status is not just about recognition but also about ensuring that Ajay Kumar's legacy is remembered and respected. The family believes that providing pensions and canteen cards would offer a sense of security and support to the families of fallen soldiers, acknowledging their immense contribution to the nation.

As the nation mourns the loss of a brave soldier, the call for reform in the Agniveer scheme and the demand for proper recognition and benefits for the families of martyrs grow louder. The story of Ajay Kumar serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by the armed forces and the need for comprehensive support systems for their families.

The Indian Army and the government are yet to respond to the family's demands, but the appeal has sparked a wider conversation about the welfare and recognition of soldiers who lay down their lives in the line of duty.
