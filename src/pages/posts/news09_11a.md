**Kamala Will Be President for All Americans: Obama and Biden React to Harris vs. Trump Presidential Debate**

**Date: September 11, 2024**

**Washington, D.C.** – The first presidential debate of the 2024 election season saw Democratic candidate Kamala Harris square off against former President Donald Trump in a fiery and contentious exchange. The debate, held last night, showcased the stark differences between the two candidates on a range of issues, from the economy and healthcare to immigration and foreign policy.

Harris, who made history as the first woman of color to be nominated for the presidency by a major party, wasted no time in putting Trump on the defensive. She criticized his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration's immigration policies, and what she described as his divisive rhetoric that has deepened the nation’s political and social divides.

“Donald Trump’s presidency was marked by chaos, corruption, and cruelty,” Harris declared in her opening statement. “The American people deserve better, and as president, I will work for all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs, race, or background.”

Trump, in his signature style, responded with sharp retorts, accusing Harris of being part of the "radical left" and painting her policies as socialist. He defended his record, particularly his economic achievements before the pandemic and his efforts to secure the southern border.

“Kamala Harris wants to take this country down a path that will destroy what makes America great,” Trump asserted. “She’s more concerned with appeasing the far-left than with the safety and prosperity of our citizens.”

The debate was watched by millions across the country and elicited immediate reactions from key political figures. Former President Barack Obama took to social media shortly after the debate to express his support for Harris, stating, “Kamala is a leader who embodies the values and principles that have always made America strong. She will be a president for all Americans, and tonight, she showed why she’s the right choice for our future.”

President Joe Biden, who served with Harris as Vice President, also weighed in, praising her performance and reiterating his belief in her leadership. “Kamala Harris demonstrated tonight why she’s ready to lead this country. She stands for unity, justice, and progress. As President, she will bring people together and build a future where everyone has a fair shot.”

Political analysts have noted that this debate could be a defining moment in the 2024 election, with Harris’s ability to directly challenge Trump potentially swaying undecided voters. However, the debate also highlighted the deep divisions within the country, with supporters of both candidates taking to social media to voice their opinions, often in heated exchanges.

As the election draws nearer, both Harris and Trump are expected to intensify their campaigns, with each candidate seeking to rally their base while appealing to the crucial swing voters who may ultimately decide the outcome of the race.

The next debate is scheduled for later this month, and both campaigns are already gearing up for what promises to be another intense confrontation.
