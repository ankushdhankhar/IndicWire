**PMC Appeals to Pune Residents: Avoid Immersing Ganesh Idols in Natural Water Bodies**

*Pune, September 11, 2024* – In an effort to protect Pune’s natural water bodies, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has issued an appeal to residents, urging them to avoid immersing Ganesh idols in rivers, lakes, and other natural water sources during this year’s Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Instead, the PMC is setting up several artificial tanks and collection centres across the city to facilitate eco-friendly idol immersion and proper disposal of floral waste.

The initiative, part of the PMC's ongoing environmental conservation efforts, aims to reduce pollution and protect aquatic life. The immersion of plaster-of-Paris (PoP) idols and the use of non-biodegradable decorations and floral offerings have been known to cause significant harm to the city’s water bodies. By providing alternative options, the PMC hopes to encourage residents to adopt more sustainable practices.

**Artificial Immersion Tanks and Collection Centres**

To support this initiative, the PMC has installed numerous artificial tanks at key locations throughout Pune. These tanks are designed to accommodate Ganesh idols of various sizes, ensuring a safe and respectful immersion process. Additionally, collection centres have been set up for the disposal of nirmalya (floral waste) and other biodegradable materials, which will be processed for composting.

**Community Involvement and Awareness**

The PMC has also launched an awareness campaign to educate citizens about the environmental impact of traditional immersion practices. Volunteers and community leaders are working alongside the PMC to spread the message and encourage participation in the eco-friendly initiatives.

Speaking on the matter, a senior PMC official stated, "We urge all residents to cooperate with these measures. Protecting our environment is a collective responsibility, and by choosing artificial tanks, we can celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi without compromising the health of our water bodies."

**Penalties for Non-Compliance**

In addition to the appeal, the PMC has warned that strict action will be taken against those who violate the guidelines and immerse idols in natural water bodies. Patrols will be deployed at major rivers and lakes to ensure compliance, and violators could face fines.

**Looking Ahead**

The PMC’s efforts are part of a broader strategy to make Pune a more sustainable and environmentally conscious city. By encouraging eco-friendly practices during festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, the corporation aims to set a precedent for future celebrations.

Residents are encouraged to contact the PMC’s helpline for information on the nearest artificial tanks and collection centres, and to report any violations of the immersion guidelines.

This Ganesh Chaturthi, let’s come together to celebrate with devotion and care for the environment.
