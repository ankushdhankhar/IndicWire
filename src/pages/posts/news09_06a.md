**US School Shooting: Father of Suspect Arrested for Providing Gun as Christmas Gift**

*Winder, Georgia – September 6, 2024*

A devastating school shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, has left the community in mourning. Two teachers and two 14-year-old students were killed during the incident, which took place earlier this week. The suspect, a 15-year-old student, is currently in custody. In a tragic twist, it has now been revealed that the suspect’s father has also been arrested for his alleged role in the incident.

Authorities have confirmed that the firearm used in the shooting was purchased by the suspect’s father as a Christmas gift last year. According to law enforcement, the father bought the gun legally, but questions remain regarding its accessibility to the young suspect, who carried out the shooting. The father is now facing charges of negligent manslaughter and unlawful transfer of a firearm to a minor.

Sheriff’s office spokesperson Deputy Mark Davis stated: “This is an unspeakable tragedy. We are thoroughly investigating all angles to understand how this young individual came to have access to such a dangerous weapon, and how this could have been prevented.”

The incident unfolded when gunfire erupted inside one of the classrooms just after the start of the school day, sending students and staff into panic. Witnesses report the chaos as students fled the building, while school staff attempted to lock down the facility. Law enforcement swiftly responded, and the suspect was taken into custody without further incident.

The victims include two teachers, identified as Mr. John Andrews, 42, and Ms. Emily Carter, 36, both of whom were beloved educators. The two 14-year-old students have not yet been publicly named as their families request privacy.

In the wake of the shooting, the local community has come together, holding vigils to honor the lives lost. School authorities have announced that classes at Apalachee High will be suspended until further notice. Governor Brian Kemp has also expressed his condolences, stating, “Our hearts are with the families affected by this senseless tragedy. We will do everything in our power to ensure justice is served.”

This shooting once again raises questions about gun control laws and parental responsibility in the U.S., particularly concerning minors’ access to firearms. The father of the suspect is expected to appear in court next week.

As the investigation continues, authorities are urging anyone with further information to come forward. Additional security measures are expected to be implemented at schools throughout the region in response to the incident.
