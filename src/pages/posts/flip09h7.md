The Assam government has reportedly spent over Rs 58 crore on arranging helicopter rides for the travel of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, his ministerial colleagues, and other dignitaries between May 2021 and January 2024. The expenses were incurred as “airlifting/helicopter” charges.

The reply was given on **February 6** in response to a set of written questions by **Sivasagar MLA** and **Raijor Dal** leader **Akhil Gogoi**. The **Sarma** government, however, did not offer the break-up of the amount spent specifically on flights chartered by **Sarma** himself. The MLA had particularly asked for this break-up.

The year-wise break-up of the total amount stated by the government in the House was:
- **Rs. 10,19,81,946** between **May 10, 2021** and **December 31, 2022**.
- In the financial year **2022-2023**, public funds worth **Rs 34,01,05,848** were spent to charter flights and helicopters for the chief minister and other dignitaries.
- From **January 2023** to **January 2024**, the amount spent was **Rs 14,02,19,313**.

Although the sum cited by the **Sarma** government for the **2022-2023** financial year matched with an earlier statement placed at the assembly last September, it, however, hugely overshot the amount cited by it in an **RTI** reply given to **The CrossCurrent** in September. After the state government did not respond to the **RTI** application filed on **August 22, 2022** for nearly a year, the **Guwahati**-based news portal had appealed to the **State Information Commission**, seeking a reply. The commission, on **August 8, 2023**, directed the state’s **General Administration Department** to provide the information asked for through **RTI**. In **September 2023**, the state government shared information but only partially. The **RTI** application had also sought details on such spending from **May 10, 2021** till date. **May 10, 2021** was the day the new chief minister, **Sarma**, was sworn in after the **BJP** won the state assembly elections for the second time, replacing the incumbent chief minister **Sarbananda Sonowal**. The **Wire** and **The CrossCurrent**’s joint report based on the partial **RTI** reply by the **Sarma** government showed that the state government had spent crores in the chief minister’s non-governmental activities – which included attending high-profile weddings within and outside Assam and engaging in his party’s work, including campaigning for party leaders and its allies by violating the **Election Commission of India**’s model code of conduct¹.
