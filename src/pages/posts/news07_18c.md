**Oman Mosque Shooting: 6 Dead, Islamic State Claims Responsibility**

**Muscat, Oman â€“** In an unprecedented and tragic attack near a Shia mosque in Muscat, six people, including a policeman, lost their lives, and 28 others sustained injuries. The Islamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the shooting, sending shockwaves through the peaceful sultanate.

The incident occurred on the eve of Ashura, a significant and solemn day in the Shia Muslim calendar. Worshippers were gathered at the mosque for the evening prayers when gunfire erupted, plunging the congregation into chaos. Video footage from the scene shows worshippers fleeing in panic as gunshots echoed through the mosque.

Among the deceased was a policeman who was on duty near the mosque, highlighting the severity and suddenness of the attack. The Omani authorities have condemned the attack, expressing deep sorrow and vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice. Security has been heightened across the country, with a particular focus on religious sites and gatherings.

The international community has also reacted to the incident, with Pakistan and India confirming that nationals from their countries were among the casualties. This highlights the broader impact of the violence, affecting families and communities beyond Oman's borders.

In recent years, the Gulf region has witnessed multiple attacks on Shiite mosques, with incidents reported in countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. However, this latest attack marks the first of its kind in Oman, a nation known for its relative stability and peaceful coexistence of different religious communities.

The Islamic State's claim of responsibility has raised concerns about the group's ongoing ability to orchestrate and inspire attacks in the region, despite significant losses and territorial defeats in Iraq and Syria. IS has targeted Shia Muslims in various countries, aiming to incite sectarian conflict and undermine regional stability.

Oman's response to this attack will be closely watched, both domestically and internationally. The country's security forces are known for their professionalism and effectiveness, and the government is expected to take robust measures to prevent future incidents and reassure the public.

As the investigation continues, families of the victims are mourning their loss, and the nation grapples with the shock of an attack that has shattered its peace. The eve of Ashura, a day meant for reflection and mourning in the Shia tradition, has been marred by violence and tragedy, leaving a lasting impact on the community and the country as a whole.
