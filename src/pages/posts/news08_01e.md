**Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Defends Record on Train Safety, Criticizes UPA Regime**

In a heated parliamentary session, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw defended his tenure against opposition accusations regarding recent train accidents. Vaishnaw responded to slogans raised by opposition members by highlighting what he described as the "poor" track record of railway safety under previous UPA (United Progressive Alliance) regimes.

The opposition criticized the government over recent train accidents, questioning the safety measures in place and demanding accountability. In response, Vaishnaw presented data in Parliament, illustrating improvements made since the BJP-led government took charge.

**Vaishnaw Highlights Safety Measures**

Minister Vaishnaw outlined several initiatives his ministry has undertaken to enhance railway safety. These measures include technological upgrades, increased investment in railway infrastructure, and improved maintenance practices. Vaishnaw emphasized that the government's efforts have led to a significant reduction in train accidents over the years.

He cited specific statistics showing a decrease in the number of railway accidents compared to the figures recorded during the UPA's rule. Vaishnaw argued that his ministry is committed to ensuring passenger safety and has implemented comprehensive strategies to address potential risks.

**Opposition's Concerns and Counterarguments**

Opposition leaders expressed dissatisfaction with the government's response, arguing that recent accidents reflect systemic issues that need urgent attention. They accused the current administration of prioritizing speed and expansion over safety, highlighting incidents that have resulted in passenger casualties.

In counterarguments, Vaishnaw pointed to the UPA's history, alleging neglect and inadequate safety measures during their tenure. He claimed that under the UPA, the railway sector suffered from underinvestment and lack of modernization, contributing to a higher accident rate.

**Conclusion**

The exchange in Parliament underscored the ongoing political battle over railway safety and accountability. While the government defends its record and outlines future plans, the opposition continues to demand transparency and immediate action to prevent further incidents.

As railway safety remains a crucial issue, both sides are expected to intensify their efforts to address public concerns and ensure the well-being of millions of passengers across the country.
