**Biden’s Most Proud Achievement: Deepening U.S.-India Partnership, Says White House**

**Washington D.C.:** The White House has emphasized that President Joe Biden is particularly proud of his efforts to deepen the partnership between the United States and India, marking it as a cornerstone of his foreign policy achievements. According to senior officials, the U.S.-India relationship has reached unprecedented levels of cooperation across key sectors, including defense, technology, climate, and trade. This strategic alliance reflects Biden’s commitment to fostering strong ties with India as both countries play pivotal roles in shaping global security and economic landscapes.

### **Key Pillar of Biden’s Foreign Policy**

Speaking at a press briefing, the White House press secretary highlighted the importance of India as a central partner for the U.S. in addressing global challenges. "President Biden has been deeply committed to advancing this partnership since taking office. He considers the collaboration with India to be a defining element of his administration’s broader strategy in the Indo-Pacific region," the press secretary said.

Under Biden’s leadership, the U.S. has aimed to counterbalance the growing influence of China in Asia, and this is where the deepening of ties with India becomes critical. The White House emphasized that the partnership is built on shared democratic values, mutual economic interests, and the common goal of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.

### **Strategic Defense Ties**

One of the most notable aspects of the U.S.-India relationship under Biden has been the strengthening of defense cooperation. In recent years, both countries have signed landmark defense agreements that allow for greater interoperability of their military forces. These agreements, which focus on intelligence sharing, logistics support, and joint military exercises, have been seen as a critical step toward deterring threats in the region, particularly from China.

The Biden administration has also supported India's acquisition of advanced U.S. military technology. In June 2023, the two countries announced a deal to co-develop jet engines, as part of a broader initiative to promote defense innovation and collaboration.

### **Technological and Economic Collaboration**

Beyond defense, technology collaboration has been another highlight of the Biden-Modi partnership. Both countries have worked closely on critical technologies such as semiconductor manufacturing, AI, and quantum computing, with an emphasis on fostering supply chain resilience in the face of global challenges.

During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the U.S. in June 2024, Biden announced significant investments in India’s tech infrastructure, including projects related to clean energy and the digital economy. Indian-American entrepreneurs in the U.S. have also played a key role in driving this collaboration forward.

### **Climate Action and Clean Energy**

President Biden has also emphasized the need for joint action on climate change. The U.S. and India have committed to expanding their cooperation in renewable energy, with a particular focus on solar power and electric vehicles. Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, has visited India multiple times to engage in discussions on how both countries can work together to meet their carbon reduction targets.

A significant part of this cooperation is the U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership, which aims to mobilize finance, technology, and support for India’s ambitious climate goals. Both countries are working to expand their clean energy partnership, aligning their goals for a greener future.

### **A Personal Connection**

The White House has also pointed to the warm relationship between President Biden and Prime Minister Modi. The two leaders have met multiple times during Biden’s tenure, and their personal rapport has helped bridge gaps and accelerate cooperation between the two nations. 

During their meetings, Biden and Modi have often spoken of the long-standing historical and cultural ties between the two democracies, with Biden underscoring the importance of the Indian-American community in the U.S., which has grown significantly in influence over the past few decades.

### **Geopolitical Impact and the Indo-Pacific Focus**

The growing U.S.-India partnership is seen as a cornerstone in Biden’s broader Indo-Pacific strategy. With China’s growing assertiveness in the region, the U.S. has sought to build strong alliances to counterbalance Beijing’s influence. India, as a major power in the Indo-Pacific, plays a key role in this strategy.

Through the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, Biden has sought to create a cooperative framework to promote regional security, economic cooperation, and stability. The White House has reiterated that the U.S.-India partnership is essential for ensuring peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

### **Looking Forward**

As President Biden looks ahead to the remainder of his term, the White House has underscored that deepening ties with India will continue to be a top priority. With shared goals in areas such as defense, technology, climate, and regional stability, the future of the U.S.-India relationship appears bright.

"President Biden sees this partnership not only as a legacy of his administration but also as a testament to the enduring friendship between two great democracies," the White House press secretary stated, adding that further announcements are expected in the coming months as both nations explore new areas for collaboration.
