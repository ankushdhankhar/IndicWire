**Headline:** Israel Conducts ‘Limited, Localised, Targeted Operational Activities’ in Southwestern Lebanon Against Hezbollah

**Date:** October 8, 2024

**Location:** Jerusalem/Beirut

In a significant escalation of regional tensions, Israel's military has confirmed that it is conducting "limited, localised, targeted operational activities" inside southwestern Lebanon, marking a dangerous uptick in hostilities with Hezbollah. This development comes as Israel has deployed its reserve 146th division to carry out these operations, which it claims are aimed at neutralizing “Hezbollah terror targets and infrastructure.”

### **Israeli Military's Statement**

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) released an official statement outlining the deployment of the 146th division into Lebanon, focusing on areas where they allege Hezbollah maintains a significant presence. The IDF has characterized these operations as precautionary and defensive in nature, designed to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure and to prevent potential threats from materializing in the form of rocket attacks or cross-border incursions.

“We are engaging in limited, localized, and targeted actions to destroy terror cells, weapon stockpiles, and operational bases of Hezbollah,” the IDF’s statement read. "These activities are necessary to safeguard the security of our citizens and maintain regional stability."

### **Background of Escalation**

Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been escalating over the past few weeks, with both sides accusing each other of violating ceasefires and triggering border skirmishes. Reports of rocket fire from southern Lebanon into northern Israel have spurred retaliatory airstrikes by the Israeli Air Force in recent days.

Hezbollah, a Shiite militant group backed by Iran, has maintained a substantial military presence in southern Lebanon since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. The group has often been seen as a formidable foe to Israel, with a vast arsenal of rockets capable of reaching deep into Israeli territory. Israel has been increasingly concerned about Hezbollah’s growing influence and infrastructure, which has been reportedly strengthened by Iran and Syria.

### **Hezbollah's Response**

Hezbollah has yet to issue an official response to the latest Israeli incursion. However, local sources in Lebanon have reported sporadic gunfire and small-scale clashes between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces near the border areas. Lebanese media outlets linked to Hezbollah have described the Israeli operation as an "unjustified act of aggression," vowing to respond if Israel continues to violate Lebanon’s sovereignty.

In previous escalations, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has warned that any significant Israeli action on Lebanese soil would be met with a strong and immediate response, raising concerns of a broader conflict between the two sides.

### **Impact on Civilians**

The border region between Israel and Lebanon has seen a series of clashes, raising alarm among the civilian populations on both sides. In Israel’s northern towns, residents have been asked to remain in shelters or be on high alert, while in southwestern Lebanon, many villages have seen the displacement of families as fears of intensifying conflict grow.

The Lebanese government, already grappling with internal political and economic crises, has called on the United Nations to intervene and prevent further Israeli military actions. Lebanon’s Foreign Ministry has condemned what it calls a "flagrant violation" of its sovereignty and has urged international bodies to take immediate steps to defuse the situation.

### **International Reactions**

The international community has expressed growing concern over the mounting tensions. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has been tasked with maintaining peace along the Israel-Lebanon border since 2006, has called for restraint from both sides and is closely monitoring the situation.

The United States and European Union have also issued statements urging de-escalation, stressing the importance of preventing the outbreak of a larger conflict. Both Washington and Brussels have reiterated their support for Israel’s right to defend itself but have also called on Israel to avoid actions that could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon.

### **Conclusion**

The situation remains volatile, with Israeli forces engaging in what they describe as targeted strikes against Hezbollah. As the world watches closely, the fear of a broader war looms large, especially given the deep-rooted animosities and the volatile dynamics in the region. With both Israel and Hezbollah entrenched in their positions, the coming days will likely determine whether this latest confrontation escalates further or if diplomatic efforts can prevent a full-blown conflict. 

For now, the border region remains on edge, with uncertainty gripping both sides as they brace for what may come next.
