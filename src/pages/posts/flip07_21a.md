### Indian Working Women Experience Higher Levels of Stress Than Males: YourDost Mental Health Survey

**New Delhi, July 21, 2024** â€” A recent mental health survey conducted by YourDost, an online mental wellness platform, reveals that Indian working women are experiencing significantly higher levels of stress compared to their male counterparts. The comprehensive study sheds light on the pressing mental health challenges faced by women in the workforce and highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions and support systems.

#### Survey Methodology and Demographics

The YourDost survey, conducted over six months, included responses from 10,000 working professionals across various sectors in India. The participants comprised 5,500 women and 4,500 men, ranging in age from 22 to 45 years. The survey aimed to assess the mental health status, stress levels, and contributing factors to workplace stress among the respondents.

#### Key Findings

**1. Higher Stress Levels Among Women:**
The survey found that 72% of working women reported high levels of stress, compared to 58% of men. The stress levels were measured based on self-reported feelings of anxiety, fatigue, and inability to cope with daily tasks.

**2. Work-Life Balance Challenges:**
One of the primary stressors for women was the struggle to balance professional responsibilities with personal and family commitments. 68% of women reported difficulty in maintaining a work-life balance, whereas only 45% of men faced similar challenges.

**3. Gender-Based Discrimination:**
Women also reported higher instances of gender-based discrimination and bias at the workplace. About 54% of women felt that they had to work harder than their male colleagues to prove their competence, compared to 30% of men who felt similarly.

**4. Lack of Support Systems:**
The survey highlighted a significant gap in support systems for women. Only 35% of women felt that their employers provided adequate mental health support, while 50% of men believed they had sufficient support.

**5. Impact on Mental Health:**
High stress levels among women have led to adverse mental health outcomes, including increased rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout. The survey indicated that 42% of women had sought professional help for mental health issues in the past year, compared to 28% of men.

#### Expert Opinions

Mental health experts suggest that the findings reflect deep-rooted societal and cultural norms that place disproportionate pressures on women. Dr. Anjali Mehta, a clinical psychologist, explained, "Women often juggle multiple roles, including that of a caregiver, homemaker, and professional. This multitasking, coupled with societal expectations, significantly contributes to their elevated stress levels."

#### Organizational Initiatives and Recommendations

In response to the survey findings, YourDost recommends several measures that organizations can implement to support their female employees better:

1. **Flexible Work Policies:** Introducing flexible working hours and remote work options to help women manage their personal and professional responsibilities more effectively.

2. **Mental Health Programs:** Establishing comprehensive mental health programs that include counseling services, stress management workshops, and regular mental health check-ups.

3. **Gender Sensitization Training:** Conducting training sessions to raise awareness about gender bias and discrimination, fostering a more inclusive and supportive work environment.

4. **Support Networks:** Creating support groups and mentorship programs to provide women with guidance, encouragement, and a platform to share their experiences.

#### Conclusion

The YourDost mental health survey underscores the critical need for organizations to prioritize the mental well-being of their female employees. By addressing the unique challenges faced by working women and implementing supportive measures, workplaces can create a more balanced and healthier environment for all employees.
