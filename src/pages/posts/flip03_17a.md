**Rahul Gandhi**  has embarked on the **last phase of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra** in Maharashtra. This yatra aims to connect with ordinary people across the country and highlight the message of justice (*nyay*). Here are the key details about his recent tour to Maharashtra:

- **Starting Point**: **Nandurbar district**, a tribal-dominated region in Maharashtra.
- **Significance**: This marks the **first visit by a member of the Gandhi family to Nandurbar since 2010**.
- **Cancelled Visit**: In 2014, **Sonia Gandhi** was scheduled to visit Nandurbar, but her program was canceled due to ill-health.
- **Activities in Nandurbar**:
    - **Traditional Tribal Holi Bonfire**: Rahul Gandhi participated in a traditional tribal Holi bonfire event (*Adivasi Nyay Holi Sammelan*).
    - **Addressed a Rally**: He addressed a rally called *Advasi Nyay Sabha* in the district.
- **Yatra Details**:
    - The yatra started in strife-torn Manipur on January 14.
    - It will culminate in **Mumbai** later this month after traversing **6,700 kilometers through 15 states**.
    - The Maharashtra leg of the yatra covers over **400 kilometers** and includes stops in Dhule, Malegaon, Nashik, and Thane before reaching Mumbai on March 16.
- **Tribal Focus**: By adding "adivasi" (tribal) to the name of the political rally, the Congress party aims to attract tribal voters by addressing their issues.
- **Political Context**:
    - Nandurbar was historically a bastion of Congress, electing the party's candidate eight times in Lok Sabha polls until 2014.
    - However, in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP managed to defeat the Congress in Nandurbar¬≤‚Å¥.

This yatra seeks to engage with citizens, understand their concerns, and advocate for justice across different regions of India. üáÆüá≥
