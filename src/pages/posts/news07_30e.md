### Devastating Landslides in Kerala’s Wayanad District Result in Over 50 Fatalities

#### Wayanad, Kerala — July 30, 2024

In a tragic series of events, Wayanad district in Kerala has been hit by severe landslides following incessant rainfall, resulting in at least 52 fatalities and potentially hundreds more trapped. The landslides, occurring within a span of four hours, have wreaked havoc in the hilly regions near Meppadi, devastating villages such as Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, and Noolpuzha.

#### Swift and Comprehensive Rescue Operations

In response to the disaster, extensive rescue operations have been launched, involving multiple agencies including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the Indian Army. A contingent of 225 personnel, alongside medical teams, has been deployed to the affected areas. The Indian Air Force is actively participating in the rescue efforts, utilizing two helicopters—a Mi-17 and an ALH—to expedite the search and rescue operations.

State Minister Veena George announced the involvement of a Navy team to bolster the rescue efforts. However, the rescue operations face significant challenges due to continuous rainfall, obstructive debris, and boulders.

#### Government’s Response and Support

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in constant contact with Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, assuring full support from the central government. The Prime Minister's Office has declared compensatory aid, offering Rs 2 lakh for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.

Chief Minister Vijayan has assigned a delegation of five ministers to oversee the relief operations in Wayanad, emphasizing the coordinated efforts of various government systems in addressing the disaster. A control room has been set up to streamline the aid efforts, with emergency helpline numbers 9656938689 and 8086010833 made available for those in need.

#### Infrastructure Damage and Challenges

The landslides have caused significant damage to local infrastructure. The destruction of a key bridge in Chooralmala has severed vital connectivity to nearby towns, complicating the relief efforts. Numerous homes have been demolished, and trees have been uprooted, further exacerbating the situation in the picturesque region known for its tea estates.

#### Meteorological Alerts and Safety Warnings

The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for heavy rainfall in the northern districts of Kerala, urging residents and visitors to exercise heightened caution. The continuous rainfall poses ongoing risks of additional landslides and flooding, making the rescue and relief operations even more critical.

#### Conclusion

The devastating landslides in Wayanad highlight the urgent need for continued rescue and relief efforts. With the unified response of local, state, and central agencies, there is hope for mitigating the impact of this calamity. The support and solidarity from across the nation play a crucial role in aiding the affected communities as they navigate this challenging time.
