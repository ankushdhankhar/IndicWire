### **Allegations of Organ Trafficking, Sex-Drug Racket in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata**

**Kolkata, August 19, 2024** — Shocking allegations have emerged from one of Kolkata’s most reputed institutions, the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The hospital, which has served as a cornerstone of medical education and treatment in West Bengal for decades, is now under intense scrutiny following reports of an organ trafficking racket, coupled with a sex and drug scandal involving several hospital staff members.

#### **Allegations Emerge**

The scandal came to light after a series of sting operations conducted by a local investigative news outlet, which revealed a nexus between certain doctors, hospital staff, and external agents. According to the reports, the racket involved the illegal procurement and sale of human organs, particularly kidneys and livers, from unsuspecting patients. These organs were allegedly sold at exorbitant prices in the black market, often to wealthy recipients from within and outside India.

The investigation further uncovered a parallel operation within the hospital premises involving a sex racket and drug distribution. It is alleged that certain sections of the hospital were being used for the trafficking of women, including minors, who were forced into prostitution. Drugs were reportedly being supplied to these women to keep them subdued, with some of these substances allegedly procured from the hospital’s own pharmacy.

#### **Victims Speak Out**

Several victims have come forward with harrowing accounts of their experiences. One such victim, a 22-year-old woman who wished to remain anonymous, claimed that she was lured to the hospital under the pretense of a job offer. Instead, she was trapped in a cycle of drug abuse and sexual exploitation. Another victim, a patient who underwent a routine surgery, alleged that he was coerced into donating his kidney without his full consent, under the threat of not receiving proper medical care.

#### **Police and Government Response**

The revelations have prompted immediate action from both the Kolkata Police and the West Bengal government. A special task force has been constituted to investigate the allegations. The police have already conducted raids at the hospital and surrounding areas, leading to the arrest of several individuals, including two senior doctors, a few nurses, and non-medical staff members.

The West Bengal Health Department has suspended several hospital officials pending an inquiry. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in a press statement, condemned the incident and assured the public that no stone would be left unturned in bringing the perpetrators to justice. She has also ordered a thorough review of the hospital's administration and security protocols.

#### **Public Outrage and Protests**

The scandal has sparked widespread outrage among the public and within the medical community. Protests erupted outside RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, with angry citizens demanding accountability and swift justice. Medical students and junior doctors, shocked by the allegations, have also organized demonstrations, calling for a clean-up of the institution and stringent punishment for those involved.

Local politicians have also weighed in on the controversy, with opposition parties accusing the state government of neglect and demanding an independent investigation to ensure transparency.

#### **Impact on RG Kar Medical College and Hospital**

The reputation of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital has taken a severe hit due to these allegations. Once hailed as a premier institution, it now faces the daunting task of restoring public trust. The hospital’s administration has announced that it will cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations and has initiated an internal review to identify and rectify any lapses in oversight.

#### **Ongoing Investigation**

As the investigation continues, more details are expected to emerge. The authorities are currently tracing the financial transactions linked to the organ trafficking ring and the network of individuals involved in the sex-drug racket. The police have urged anyone with information to come forward, assuring them of protection.

The case has also drawn the attention of national agencies, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) reportedly considering taking over the probe due to the gravity and possible interstate implications of the crimes involved.

#### **Conclusion**

The RG Kar Medical College and Hospital scandal has cast a dark shadow over Kolkata’s healthcare system, raising critical questions about the ethics and integrity of medical institutions. As the investigation unfolds, the focus will be on ensuring justice for the victims and implementing measures to prevent such heinous activities from occurring in the future.
