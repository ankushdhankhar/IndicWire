**Delhi Ministers to Inspect Roads in the Next Week; Repairs Scheduled Around Diwali: CM Atishi**

*New Delhi, September 29, 2024* – In an effort to address the deteriorating condition of roads across the national capital, Delhi's ministers will begin inspecting key routes over the next week, Chief Minister Atishi announced today. The inspection drive comes as part of a larger plan to repair over 2,000 potholes identified on the city’s arterial and main roads, managed by the Public Works Department (PWD).

This initiative has been timed with the approaching Diwali season, as Atishi aims to ensure the roads are in optimal condition to handle the heavy traffic expected during the festive period. The PWD, responsible for maintaining around 1,400 kilometers of these key roads, has identified potholes and stretches requiring urgent repair.

"Road safety and smooth commuting are top priorities for our government. We will be conducting these inspections personally to ensure that the work progresses in a timely and efficient manner," CM Atishi stated. She emphasized that the road repair plan will be implemented swiftly, with a target to complete major repairs by Diwali.

The inspection drive will cover various parts of the city, particularly focusing on areas that see high volumes of traffic. According to the PWD, they have already earmarked the most severely affected stretches, and teams will be deployed round the clock to conduct the necessary repairs.

Atishi added that the inspection is a part of a broader vision to revamp the capital's infrastructure and ensure better road conditions throughout the year. "We are committed to making Delhi's roads safer and smoother. We will use this inspection period to identify additional long-term improvements to enhance the city's overall infrastructure."

The PWD will coordinate with other government agencies to minimize disruptions during the repair work, ensuring smoother traffic management while roadwork is underway. For motorists and residents concerned about potholes in their areas, the department has also set up a helpline to report problem spots for immediate attention.

As the city braces for the festive season, Delhiites hope the repair work will significantly improve road conditions and reduce the number of accidents caused by potholes and poor road maintenance.
