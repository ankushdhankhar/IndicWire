### **Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia Set to Contest Haryana Assembly Elections 2024 as Congress Candidates**

**Chandigarh, September 4, 2024** â€” In a significant development ahead of the Haryana Assembly elections, two of India's prominent athletes, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, are expected to enter the political arena as candidates for the Indian National Congress. According to sources within the party, Phogat is likely to contest from the Julana constituency, while Punia is being fielded from the Badli constituency. The formal announcement is expected to be made soon by the Congress Central Election Committee (CEC).

### **Athletes Turn Politicians**

Vinesh Phogat, a celebrated wrestler with multiple international accolades, including medals in the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, hails from a family deeply rooted in the sport. She has been vocal about various social issues and has recently taken an active role in advocating for the rights of athletes and farmers. Her candidacy from Julana is seen as a strategic move by the Congress, aiming to tap into her popularity and the influence of her family in the region.

Bajrang Punia, another stalwart of Indian wrestling with a string of medals from global championships, is expected to contest from Badli. Punia has also been at the forefront of athletes' rights movements and has a strong following among the youth. His entry into politics is anticipated to energize the Congress campaign, particularly in rural areas where wrestling is a revered sport.

### **Political Strategy and Implications**

The Congress party's decision to field these two athletes is part of a broader strategy to appeal to the youth and sports communities in Haryana, a state with a rich tradition in wrestling and other sports. By bringing in popular and respected figures like Phogat and Punia, the party aims to counter the influence of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the regional parties, including the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD).

Julana, where Vinesh Phogat is likely to contest, is a key constituency in the Jind district, traditionally a stronghold of the INLD. Her entry could alter the dynamics in the region, given her family's influence and her personal popularity. Similarly, Bajrang Punia's candidacy from Badli, located in the Jhajjar district, could pose a significant challenge to the BJP, which has a strong presence in the area.

### **Awaiting Official Confirmation**

While the news of their candidacy has generated significant buzz, the Congress CEC is expected to confirm their nominations in the coming days. Party insiders suggest that the move is part of a broader strategy to field candidates with strong local connect and mass appeal, especially in constituencies where the party faces stiff competition.

### **Public Reactions**

The news of Phogat and Punia's potential candidacies has been met with excitement among their fans and supporters. Social media platforms are abuzz with discussions on their political prospects, with many expressing hope that they will bring the same dedication and determination to politics as they have to their sporting careers.

As the Haryana Assembly elections approach, all eyes will be on these two sports icons as they prepare to make their mark in the political arena. Their entry is expected to add a new dimension to the electoral battle, making the 2024 polls one of the most closely watched in recent history.
