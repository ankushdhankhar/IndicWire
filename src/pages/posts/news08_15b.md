**78th Independence Day: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Announces 75,000 New Medical Seats and Focuses on Youth Health and Nutrition**

**New Delhi, August 15, 2024** — In his address to the nation on the occasion of India’s 78th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the addition of 75,000 new medical seats across the country. The initiative, part of the government's ongoing efforts to bolster the healthcare sector, aims to address the growing demand for medical professionals and improve healthcare accessibility, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

### **Expansion of Medical Education**

The Prime Minister highlighted that the addition of these seats is a significant step towards making medical education more accessible and affordable. “With these 75,000 new seats, we are not only expanding the opportunities for our youth to pursue medical careers but also ensuring that every region of our country has access to quality healthcare professionals,” Modi said. The expansion is expected to include both undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses and will be implemented across government and private institutions.

This move aligns with the government’s broader objective of transforming India into a global hub for medical education. The new seats will help bridge the gap between the demand and supply of healthcare professionals, which has been a persistent challenge in India, particularly in rural areas.

### **Focus on Youth Health and Nutrition**

In his address, Prime Minister Modi also emphasized the importance of youth health and nutrition as critical areas of focus for the nation’s development. He outlined several initiatives aimed at improving the health and well-being of the younger population. The Prime Minister stressed that a healthy youth population is vital for the country’s future, and the government is committed to providing the necessary resources and support.

Key initiatives discussed included the expansion of the mid-day meal program in schools, with a renewed focus on nutritional quality. Modi announced that the government would introduce fortified foods and nutritional supplements in school meals to combat malnutrition and ensure that children receive the nutrients they need for healthy development.

Additionally, the Prime Minister spoke about the importance of physical fitness and mental health among the youth. He announced plans to integrate sports and fitness programs into the school curriculum, encouraging students to participate in physical activities regularly. The government will also increase investment in mental health services, aiming to provide better access to counseling and support for young people facing mental health challenges.

### **Conclusion**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day address underscored the government’s commitment to strengthening India’s healthcare system and improving the overall health and well-being of its youth. The announcement of 75,000 new medical seats is a bold step toward enhancing medical education and ensuring that every Indian has access to quality healthcare. The focus on youth health and nutrition reflects the government’s recognition of the vital role that the younger generation plays in shaping the country’s future. 

As India celebrates its 78th year of independence, these initiatives mark a significant stride towards a healthier, more prosperous nation.
