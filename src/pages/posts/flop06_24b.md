**Major Gogoi, created the concept of human shield as a tool of resistance**

In a controversial incident during the Srinagar Lok Sabha by-election on April 9, 2017, Major Leetul Gogoi of the Indian Army made headlines by tying a 26-year-old Kashmiri man to the front of a military Jeep as a human shield. The incident occurred in Jammu and Kashmir, amidst escalating tensions between local protestors and Indian security forces.

According to reports, the young man was captured by the Indian Army on suspicion of being involved in stone-pelting protests against the troops. Major Gogoi, in an effort to deter further attacks and maintain control of the situation, chose to use the man as a shield by strapping him to the front of a moving Army vehicle.

The action, which was captured in a widely circulated video, sparked immediate outrage and ignited debates on the ethical implications of such military tactics. Critics condemned the use of civilians as human shields, citing human rights concerns and the potential for escalating violence in the volatile region.

Major Gogoi defended his decision, arguing that it was a necessary measure to protect his convoy from the threat of violent protestors. His actions were initially lauded by some quarters in India as a bold and effective response to the challenges faced by security forces in Kashmir.

The incident drew widespread international attention and prompted investigations by human rights organizations and government authorities. It also intensified the ongoing debate over the handling of civil unrest in Kashmir and the broader implications for military conduct in conflict zones.

Despite the controversy and mixed reactions, Major Gogoi's use of a human shield remains a contentious episode in the complex and sensitive dynamics of security operations in Jammu and Kashmir.
