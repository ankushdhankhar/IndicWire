**Historic Voter Turnout in Phase 1 of Jammu & Kashmir Assembly Polls: 'Peaceful' Voting Marks Democratic Milestone**

**Jammu & Kashmir, September 24, 2024** – The first phase of Jammu and Kashmir's assembly elections witnessed an unprecedented voter turnout, marking a historic moment in the region’s democratic process. Voting took place in 24 constituencies, with 16 seats contested in the Kashmir Valley and 8 in the Jammu region.

Polling stations saw long queues from early morning, with the Election Commission reporting an overall turnout exceeding 70%. The peaceful voting process was praised by officials, security forces, and political leaders alike. Voters braved harsh weather in some regions, showing a strong commitment to democracy and voicing their aspirations for peace, development, and stability.

### High Turnout in Kashmir Valley
In the Kashmir Valley, where elections have often been marred by low voter engagement, phase 1 saw an unexpected surge in participation. Out of the 16 constituencies, many reported voter turnouts significantly higher than previous elections, with some areas crossing 65%. This increase was attributed to greater security presence, efforts by local leaders to encourage participation, and the government's push for inclusive elections.

Youth and first-time voters were particularly enthusiastic, with many expressing optimism about shaping the future of the region. "This is my first time voting, and I want to see a government that brings real change to Kashmir," said Faizan Ahmad, a 20-year-old student from Baramulla.

### Peace and Security
Security arrangements were tight, with a multi-tier system deployed by central and local forces to ensure a peaceful electoral process. Drones, surveillance equipment, and additional checkpoints were set up to prevent any disruptions. Despite concerns of potential unrest, the polling was largely incident-free, with only a few minor clashes reported in isolated areas.

Chief Election Officer of Jammu and Kashmir, Hirdesh Kumar, lauded the electorate's peaceful participation, saying, "This historic turnout reflects the people's desire for democracy and progress. We are committed to ensuring a smooth and fair election process across all phases."

### Political Responses
Political leaders across the spectrum welcomed the high voter engagement. The National Conference (NC), People’s Democratic Party (PDP), and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) all issued statements congratulating voters for their civic participation.

Omar Abdullah, vice-president of NC, said, “Today’s massive turnout shows the resilience and commitment of the people of Kashmir to elect a government that works for their future.”

Meanwhile, the BJP's J&K unit expressed optimism about its prospects in both regions. Senior party leader Ravinder Raina stated, “The historic turnout is a clear signal that the people are voting for development, peace, and the end of dynastic politics. We are confident of a strong showing in both Jammu and Kashmir."

### Jammu Region
In the Jammu region, voting was brisk in all eight constituencies, with many areas reporting voter turnouts of more than 75%. The region has traditionally seen stronger participation compared to the Valley, and this election proved no exception.

Several constituencies in Jammu are witnessing intense competition between BJP and Congress candidates. The BJP has focused its campaign on development and national security, while the Congress is banking on issues like unemployment and the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status to resonate with voters.

### Next Phases
The election process in Jammu and Kashmir will continue in multiple phases, with 66 seats yet to be contested. Phase 2 is scheduled to take place next week, with similar security and logistical preparations underway to ensure a smooth polling experience.

The Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls are being held for the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, making this election a critical turning point in the political and social landscape of the region. The final results are expected to be announced after the last phase of voting, and many believe this election could redefine the political future of Jammu and Kashmir.
