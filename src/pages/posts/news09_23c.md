**Atishi Takes Charge as Delhi CM, Leaves Arvind Kejriwal's Chair Symbolically Empty**

**New Delhi, September 23, 2024**: AAP leader and senior Delhi cabinet minister Atishi assumed the role of Chief Minister of Delhi today, but in a symbolic gesture, left the chair beside her vacant, proclaiming it as *“Arvind Kejriwal’s chair.”* The move came as a powerful reminder of Kejriwal’s influence and ongoing leadership within the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), despite his current absence due to legal challenges.

Atishi, known for her significant contributions to Delhi’s education reforms, took on the responsibility of leading the government in Kejriwal’s absence. In a press briefing after officially assuming the role, Atishi made it clear that the leadership change was temporary and that Kejriwal’s guidance remained at the core of the party’s governance.

*"This is Arvind Kejriwal's chair,"* Atishi remarked, pointing to the vacant seat beside her during the swearing-in ceremony. *"He is our leader, and everything we do as a government continues to reflect his vision for Delhi. I am here to carry forward the work he started, and we all eagerly await his return."*

The gesture struck a chord with AAP supporters, highlighting Kejriwal's continuing influence. The Delhi CM is facing legal scrutiny in connection with ongoing investigations, resulting in his temporary unavailability to discharge his official duties. His absence has led to widespread speculation about AAP’s leadership and the party’s stability in the capital.

**Atishi's Priorities as CM**

Taking the reins of the Delhi government, Atishi reaffirmed her commitment to delivering on key policy areas such as education, health, and public welfare, the pillars of AAP’s governance model. *"We will continue to focus on improving the lives of the people of Delhi, and there will be no compromise on the promises made to the citizens,"* she stated.

One of her top priorities will be maintaining the momentum in education reform, a sector where she has been credited with achieving significant improvements. She also emphasized the need for continuity in Delhi’s health infrastructure, sustainable urban development, and ensuring efficient public services.

**Political Climate and Legal Context**

Atishi’s symbolic move to keep Kejriwal’s chair empty is seen as a tactical decision to maintain AAP’s narrative that their leader’s absence is only temporary. Kejriwal has been under the scanner in connection with a series of allegations related to financial irregularities. His supporters have dismissed these claims as politically motivated, while AAP continues to defend his legacy of governance.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has seized upon the legal challenges faced by Kejriwal as an opportunity to criticize AAP’s leadership. However, with Atishi at the helm, the party seems confident in navigating this turbulent phase.

**A Growing Political Star**

Atishi, who has emerged as a central figure within AAP, is widely respected for her work and often seen as a rising political star in the party. Her close association with Kejriwal and her reputation for efficient governance have earned her significant support within the party and among the public. However, as Delhi’s new chief minister, even if temporarily, she faces the challenge of maintaining both the political stability and the policy momentum set by Kejriwal.

**Conclusion**

Atishi's assumption of the Delhi Chief Minister's office, accompanied by the symbolic gesture of leaving Arvind Kejriwal's chair empty, underscores her commitment to carrying forward his legacy while awaiting his return. As she navigates the capital’s political waters, Atishi is expected to continue steering the Delhi government’s focus on welfare and development, bolstered by her experience and determination.
