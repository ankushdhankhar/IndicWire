**India Supports ‘Early, Abiding, and Peaceful Resolution’ of Russia-Ukraine Conflict: PM Modi to Russian President Putin**

**Date:** August 27, 2024

**Location:** New Delhi, India

In a significant diplomatic exchange, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, emphasizing the need for an "early, abiding, and peaceful resolution." This statement was made during a phone conversation between Prime Minister Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, following Modi's recent visit to Ukraine.

### **The Conversation: A Diplomatic Exchange**

According to official sources, the conversation between the two leaders centered around the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the broader implications for global security and stability. Prime Minister Modi expressed India's deep concern over the humanitarian crisis and the continuing hostilities that have caused widespread suffering and displacement.

Modi reiterated India's consistent position that dialogue and diplomacy are the only viable pathways to resolving the conflict. He urged President Putin to consider a ceasefire and engage in negotiations with Ukraine, with the support of the international community. India, as a key player in the global south and a non-aligned nation, has consistently called for respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of all nations, including Ukraine.

### **India’s Balancing Act**

India has maintained a delicate balance in its approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. While it has abstained from voting on certain UN resolutions condemning Russia's actions, India has also expressed its concern over the humanitarian impact of the war. This diplomatic tightrope has allowed India to preserve its strategic partnership with Russia, a key defense supplier, while also keeping open lines of communication with Western powers and Ukraine.

During the conversation, President Putin briefed Prime Minister Modi on the current situation on the ground, including Russia's strategic interests and security concerns. Putin reiterated Russia's stance on the conflict and its reasons for military actions. The exchange was described as frank and open, reflecting the mutual respect between the two leaders.

### **Recent Developments: Modi's Visit to Ukraine**

Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Ukraine was seen as a significant step in India's engagement with the ongoing conflict. During the visit, Modi met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other high-ranking officials. The discussions focused on humanitarian aid, reconstruction efforts, and the broader geopolitical implications of the conflict.

Modi's visit was interpreted as a signal of India's willingness to play a more active role in seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict. India has already provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and expressed its willingness to contribute to the reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country.

### **Global Reactions**

The international community has closely monitored India's diplomatic maneuvers in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Western powers have welcomed India's call for peace and dialogue, viewing it as a positive development. However, there is also cautious optimism regarding India's ability to influence the outcome of the conflict, given its close ties with Russia.

Meanwhile, Russia has appreciated India's understanding of its security concerns, though it remains steadfast in its objectives in Ukraine. The ongoing dialogue between India and Russia underscores the complex nature of global diplomacy, where nations must navigate competing interests and alliances.

### **Looking Forward: India’s Role in Global Diplomacy**

India's engagement with both Russia and Ukraine positions it as a potential mediator in the conflict. As a rising global power, India's voice is increasingly important in international forums. The country’s emphasis on dialogue, respect for sovereignty, and peaceful resolution of conflicts resonates with many nations facing similar challenges.

Prime Minister Modi's conversation with President Putin is expected to be a precursor to further diplomatic efforts by India to bring about peace in Ukraine. The international community will be watching closely to see how India leverages its influence to contribute to a resolution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations involved.

India's commitment to a peaceful and enduring resolution to the conflict is a reflection of its broader foreign policy goals—promoting global peace, stability, and cooperation in a rapidly changing world order.
