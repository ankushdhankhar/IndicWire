**CBI Gets 8-Day Custody of Former RG Kar Principal Sandip Ghosh in Corruption Case: ‘Large Nexus Needs to be Exposed’**

*Kolkata, September 3, 2024* — In a significant development, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has secured an 8-day custody of Dr. Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of the prestigious RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, in connection with a corruption case that has rocked the medical and educational circles of West Bengal.

Dr. Ghosh, who was arrested on September 2, is accused of being involved in a large-scale corruption scandal that allegedly involved the misuse of funds, manipulation of college admissions, and irregularities in the procurement of medical equipment. The CBI, during a special hearing at the Alipore Court, argued that Dr. Ghosh played a central role in a "large nexus" of individuals and entities engaged in corrupt practices, and his extended custody was essential to uncover the full extent of this network.

### Court Proceedings and CBI's Argument

The CBI, represented by Special Public Prosecutor Arindam Chakraborty, emphasized the complexity and reach of the corruption scandal. "This is not an isolated incident but part of a larger nexus involving multiple stakeholders, including suppliers, intermediaries, and possibly other officials. Dr. Ghosh's custodial interrogation is crucial to exposing this network and preventing further erosion of public trust in our institutions," Chakraborty stated.

The defense, led by Advocate Subir Sanyal, argued against the extended custody, claiming that Dr. Ghosh was being targeted based on circumstantial evidence and that his reputation as an academician should be considered. However, the court was convinced by the CBI's argument regarding the necessity of a thorough investigation, given the potential implications for the state's medical education system.

### Allegations and Ongoing Investigation

The investigation into Dr. Ghosh's activities began earlier this year after a whistleblower from within the medical community provided evidence suggesting significant irregularities at RG Kar Medical College during his tenure as principal. The allegations include the embezzlement of funds meant for student scholarships, procurement scams involving substandard medical equipment, and favoritism in the college's admission process.

Sources within the CBI have indicated that Dr. Ghosh is suspected of receiving kickbacks in exchange for awarding contracts and securing admissions for candidates with dubious qualifications. The agency is also probing his connections with other high-ranking officials in the medical education department and possible links to political figures.

### Public and Political Reactions

The arrest of Dr. Ghosh has sparked widespread reactions across West Bengal. Medical professionals and students have expressed shock and disappointment over the revelations. "RG Kar Medical College has always been a symbol of excellence. These allegations, if true, are a betrayal of our trust," said Dr. Aritra Sen, a senior resident doctor at the hospital.

Politically, the case has added fuel to the ongoing debate about corruption in public institutions. The ruling party has faced criticism from opposition leaders, who accuse the government of failing to prevent such widespread corruption. "This case is just the tip of the iceberg. The people of Bengal deserve to know how deep this corruption runs," stated BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari in a press conference.

### The Road Ahead

With Dr. Ghosh in custody, the CBI is expected to ramp up its investigation, possibly leading to more arrests in the coming days. The agency has assured that it will leave no stone unturned in its effort to bring all those involved to justice.

The next court hearing is scheduled for September 11, where the CBI is expected to present further findings from Dr. Ghosh's custodial interrogation.

This case is being closely monitored as it could have far-reaching consequences for the governance and administration of medical education in West Bengal.
