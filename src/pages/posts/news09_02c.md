### RSS Hints at Support for Caste Census, Advocates for Caution in Political Use

**Kerala, September 2, 2024** — In a significant development at the conclusion of its Kerala meeting, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) indicated a cautious endorsement of a caste census, framing it as a “well-established practice” instrumental for targeted welfare programs. However, the organization emphasized that such data should be handled with care and not exploited for political gains.

The RSS, a prominent Hindu nationalist organization, made these remarks during a press conference on the final day of its three-day meet in Kerala. The statements come amid ongoing debates in India regarding the implementation and impact of a comprehensive caste census.

**Caste Census as a Tool for Welfare**

Addressing reporters, RSS spokesperson Ramachandra Sinha articulated the organization’s stance, saying, “A caste census is not a novel idea. It is a well-established practice in our socio-economic landscape, crucial for tailoring welfare programs that address specific needs of various communities.” Sinha underscored that accurate demographic data could help in formulating policies that effectively target and benefit underprivileged groups.

He added, “However, it is imperative that such data is used constructively and not as a political tool. The focus should be on creating effective welfare schemes rather than fueling political agendas.”

**Position on SC/ST Sub-Quota**

In addition to discussing the caste census, the RSS addressed the contentious issue of sub-quotas within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) categories. The organization called for a broad-based consensus on the matter, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that respects the interests of all stakeholders.

Sinha remarked, “We advocate for a consensus-driven approach to sub-quotas. It is crucial that any decisions regarding reservations or sub-quotas are made through collaborative discussions and not in a manner that could lead to further divisions.”

**Political Implications and Future Directions**

The RSS’s nuanced position on the caste census and sub-quotas reflects a broader effort to balance advocacy for social justice with a cautionary stance on the potential for politicization. The organization’s call for consensus and its wariness about the misuse of caste data resonate with ongoing concerns among various political and social groups.

The discussion on caste census and reservation policies continues to be a sensitive and polarizing issue in Indian politics. The RSS’s input may influence future debates and policy decisions, potentially shaping how caste-based data is utilized and how reservation policies are structured in the coming years.

**Public and Political Reactions**

Reactions to the RSS’s statements have been mixed. Some political leaders and social activists welcome the RSS’s support for a caste census as a positive step toward more informed policymaking. Others, however, remain cautious, stressing the importance of ensuring that the data collection process is transparent and that its results are used equitably.

As the discourse evolves, stakeholders across the political spectrum are expected to weigh in on the RSS’s position, potentially impacting legislative and administrative actions related to caste-based reservations and welfare programs.

The RSS’s latest statements signal an important moment in the ongoing debate over caste census and reservation policies, setting the stage for future discussions and decisions that will shape India’s socio-political landscape.
