**India Blasts Pakistan at UN, Warns of Consequences of Terrorism**

**United Nations, September 2024** — In a sharp and forceful response, India condemned Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks on the Kashmir issue during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Exercising its Right of Reply, India's representative labeled Sharif’s statements as a "travesty," denouncing Pakistan for its persistent role in fomenting terrorism in the region.

During his address at the UNGA, Prime Minister Sharif raised the Kashmir issue once again, calling for international intervention to resolve the long-standing dispute. He accused India of violating human rights in Jammu and Kashmir and reiterated Pakistan's demand for a resolution under UN Security Council resolutions.

India's response was swift and firm. The Indian diplomat responded that Pakistan's attempts to internationalize Kashmir were not only misguided but deeply hypocritical, given Islamabad's record of promoting terrorism across the border. “Terrorism will inevitably invite consequences,” said the Indian representative, emphasizing that Pakistan's use of terror as state policy has destabilized the region for decades.

India reaffirmed its position that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and any attempts by Pakistan to intervene or spread false narratives would not change this fact. The Indian representative reminded the global community of Pakistan's continued harboring of terrorist organizations, which have not only targeted India but also global peace and security. 

India also highlighted the situation within Pakistan, pointing out the country's internal crises and urging it to focus on solving its domestic problems instead of interfering in the internal affairs of other nations. The statement pointed to the growing extremism, sectarian violence, and human rights abuses within Pakistan itself.

In a broader context, India's stance at the UN reinforced its long-held view that bilateral issues between India and Pakistan must be resolved directly without third-party interference. The response concluded by calling on Pakistan to dismantle terrorist networks operating from its soil and to act responsibly on the international stage.

The exchange is part of a larger diplomatic tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with Kashmir remaining a contentious issue since the partition of India in 1947. The region has witnessed multiple wars, skirmishes, and diplomatic showdowns, with Pakistan continuously seeking international involvement, and India maintaining that any resolution must come through bilateral dialogue.

India’s strong rebuke at the UN has once again underlined its firm stance on terrorism and its zero-tolerance policy towards cross-border attacks. The global community continues to watch the escalating rhetoric with concern, as any increase in tensions between these two countries has the potential to destabilize the broader South Asian region.
