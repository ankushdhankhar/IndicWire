**Amit Shah Criticizes Congress Governance in Haryana, Accuses it of Favoring “Dealers, Dalals, and Damaads”**

*Chandigarh, September 27, 2024* – Union Home Minister Amit Shah launched a sharp critique against the previous Congress government in Haryana, accusing it of allowing "dealers, dalals (middlemen), and damaads (sons-in-law)" to dominate the state's political and administrative landscape. Shah made these comments during a rally in Karnal, as part of his outreach efforts ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.

Shah highlighted that the previous Congress administration, which was in power in Haryana for a decade, was riddled with corruption and nepotism. “During the Congress rule, it wasn’t the people or honest governance that decided Haryana’s fate, but the dealers, dalals, and damaads,” Shah remarked, clearly alluding to the perceived influence of vested interests, intermediaries, and political families.

While Shah did not mention anyone by name, his reference to "damaad" was seen as a thinly veiled attack on Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of former Congress President Sonia Gandhi. Vadra has been embroiled in controversies related to land deals in Haryana during the Congress rule, although he has denied any wrongdoing.

### BJP’s Governance Track Record

Amit Shah further contrasted the previous Congress government's record with the current BJP-led state government under Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. He praised Khattar’s administration for rooting out corruption and working towards transparent governance. “In the last 10 years, Haryana has seen a significant transformation in terms of infrastructure, development, and employment generation, all under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Khattar,” Shah claimed.

He also pointed out the progress made in implementing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, and improvements in law and order. Shah emphasized that the current government is dedicated to public welfare, rather than catering to the interests of a select few.

### Congress Hits Back

Responding to Amit Shah’s comments, Congress leaders in Haryana dismissed his accusations as "baseless and politically motivated." Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, under whose leadership Congress ruled the state for two terms, defended his government’s legacy, claiming it was marked by rapid growth and development, particularly in sectors like agriculture and industry.

Hooda also reiterated that the BJP has failed to deliver on its promises and accused the party of diverting attention from pressing issues like unemployment and the agrarian crisis. “Instead of addressing the real concerns of the people, the BJP is resorting to personal attacks and creating imaginary narratives,” Hooda said.

### The Political Battle Ahead

With assembly elections looming, Shah’s remarks are expected to intensify the political battle in Haryana. The BJP is seeking to retain its hold on the state, while Congress is eager to reclaim its lost ground by rallying voters against what it calls the "inefficiency" of the Khattar government.

As the election campaigns heat up, both parties are likely to continue trading barbs, with governance, development, and transparency emerging as central themes of the contest.
