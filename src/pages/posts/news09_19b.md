**Israel Declares New Phase of War After Lebanon Blasts**

*Jerusalem, September 19, 2024* — Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply after Israel declared a "new phase of war" following deadly explosions in Lebanon. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant made the announcement, signaling the country's readiness for heightened military action.

The declaration came just a day after a series of blasts in southern Lebanon killed at least 12 people, reportedly involving pagers used by Hezbollah members. Israeli intelligence sources suggest that the explosions were linked to Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, though the exact cause of the blasts remains unclear.

### Incident Details
The explosions occurred in a Hezbollah-controlled area near the Israeli-Lebanese border, a known flashpoint for tensions. Initial reports from Lebanese security officials indicate that the pagers, essential to Hezbollah's communications, were tampered with or rigged to explode. While Hezbollah has not released an official statement, sources suggest they believe Israeli forces may have been behind the incident.

### Israel’s Response
In his statement, Gallant emphasized that Israel would not tolerate any threats from Hezbollah or other groups operating out of Lebanon. “This is not a one-time event; we are entering a new phase of war,” Gallant said. He outlined Israel’s plans to take preemptive measures, including bolstering its border defenses and stepping up military operations in Lebanese territory if necessary.

Gallant’s statement was reinforced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to hold Hezbollah accountable for any escalations in violence. “We will not allow any force to threaten our people. Our enemies will face the full power of the Israeli military,” Netanyahu added.

### Regional Repercussions
The situation threatens to destabilize the broader region, as both Israel and Hezbollah have a history of intense conflict. UN peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon are on high alert, and international calls for de-escalation have been growing. The United States, a key ally of Israel, expressed its support for Israel’s right to self-defense, but urged both sides to avoid further escalation.

Lebanese officials are concerned that Israel's new war phase could lead to a broader conflict. President Michel Aoun condemned Israel’s rhetoric and urged the international community to intervene, calling the blast "a provocative act."

### Background
Hezbollah, the powerful Shiite militant group backed by Iran, has long been a thorn in Israel’s side, particularly in southern Lebanon, where the group maintains a significant military presence. Skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces have escalated in recent months, raising fears of a new large-scale conflict between the two.

As the region braces for further developments, both sides remain on high alert, with potential military escalations threatening the fragile stability along the Israel-Lebanon border.
