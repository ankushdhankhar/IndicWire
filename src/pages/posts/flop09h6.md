### 'white paper on the Indian economy' in the Lok Sabha.

Certainly! The **NDA (National Democratic Alliance)** government has implemented several significant reforms to revitalize the Indian economy and address the challenges inherited from the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) era. Here are some key reforms undertaken by the NDA government:

1. **Financial Sector Revitalization**: Over the past decade, the NDA government has revitalized the stagnant financial sector. It has overhauled the credit ecosystem within the economy, resulting in significant improvements.

2. **Quality Infrastructure and Logistics**: The government's vision of "**Nation First**" has transformed the quality of India's infrastructure and logistics ecosystem. This transformation is crucial for attracting investments and expanding India's presence in global value chains. For instance, the pace of national highway construction increased from 12 km/day in FY15 to 28 km/day in FY23¹.

3. **Defense Procurement Focus**: Unlike the UPA government, which did not prioritize critical equipment procurement for the defense sector, the NDA government has emphasized defense procurement. Ensuring national security through robust defense capabilities has been a priority.

4. **Balancing 'Prakriti' and 'Pragati'**: The NDA government understands the importance of balancing environmental sustainability ("Prakriti") with progress and development ("Pragati"). Reforms have been undertaken to achieve this balance, enhancing the medium-term investment prospects of the economy.

5. **Empowerment through Welfare**: The philosophy of "**sabka sath, sabka vikas**" (inclusive development for all) has guided the NDA government. It prioritizes universal access to basic amenities and adopts a participatory, mission-mode approach to realize this vision.

6. **Technology-Based Monitoring Mechanisms**: The government has introduced technology-based monitoring mechanisms to enhance efficiency and transparency in various sectors.

Additionally, the NDA government has launched flagship schemes such as "**Make in India**," "**Skill India**," and "**Vocal for Local**," which have brought revolutionary changes to the business environment and contributed to the growth of foreign direct investment (FDI) in India¹⁴.
