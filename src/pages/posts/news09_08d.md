**Manipur Violence: CM Meets Governor, MLAs Amid Rising Fear Over Drone & Rocket Attacks, Fresh Deaths**

*Imphal, September 8, 2024* â€” The escalating violence in Manipur has prompted a series of high-level meetings as Chief Minister N. Biren Singh met with Governor Anusuiya Uikey and state MLAs to address the worsening security situation. The meeting comes amid rising fear and uncertainty following reports of drone and rocket attacks, with several fresh deaths reported over the weekend.

### **Rising Fear of Drone & Rocket Attacks**

In recent weeks, the conflict in Manipur has intensified, with reports of advanced weaponry, including drones and rocket launchers, being used in clashes between rival ethnic groups. The use of such technology has escalated the violence, leading to widespread panic among civilians. Eyewitnesses in the conflict zones have described hearing the ominous buzz of drones overhead, followed by explosions that have left several dead and many injured.

Local authorities have confirmed the deaths of at least seven people in the last 48 hours due to these attacks. The victims include women and children, heightening concerns over the safety of non-combatants in the region. In response, the state government has increased security measures, deploying additional forces to the affected areas and establishing no-fly zones in sensitive regions.

### **CM's Meeting with Governor and MLAs**

In a bid to contain the situation, Chief Minister N. Biren Singh held an urgent meeting with Governor Anusuiya Uikey at Raj Bhavan. The discussion focused on the deteriorating law and order situation and the measures being taken to restore peace. The Chief Minister also briefed the Governor on the ongoing efforts to engage with community leaders and civil society organizations to mediate a ceasefire.

Following the meeting with the Governor, the Chief Minister convened a session with state MLAs from both the ruling party and the opposition. The meeting sought to create a unified political front to address the violence. Several MLAs expressed their concerns over the inadequate security measures and the slow response of central forces in quelling the violence.

### **Humanitarian Crisis Deepens**

The ongoing violence has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Manipur, with thousands of people displaced from their homes. Relief camps are overflowing, and there are growing concerns over the shortage of food, clean water, and medical supplies. Human rights organizations have called for immediate intervention to prevent further loss of life and to provide aid to those affected by the conflict.

Speaking to the media after the meeting, CM Biren Singh urged the people of Manipur to remain calm and assured them that the government is taking all necessary steps to ensure their safety. He also appealed to the warring factions to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue to resolve the issues peacefully.

### **Conclusion**

As Manipur grapples with the escalating violence, the state government's efforts to restore peace face significant challenges. The use of advanced weaponry in the conflict has added a dangerous new dimension to the violence, making the task of restoring normalcy even more daunting. With fresh deaths reported and the fear of drone and rocket attacks growing, the people of Manipur are looking to their leaders for decisive action to end the bloodshed.
