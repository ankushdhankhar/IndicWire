**Nupur Sharma Breaks Silence After Two Years, Denounces Alleged Conspiracy Against Hindus**

*Ghaziabad, India — July 8, 2024*

In a significant public appearance after almost two years of political dormancy, former BJP leader Nupur Sharma addressed a gathering at the Bhagwat Katha held at the Ramprastha Green Campus in Ghaziabad. Sharma, who had previously been embroiled in controversy due to her remarks on religious matters, spoke out on various issues, particularly focusing on the perceived threat to Hinduism and the Sanatania community.

During her speech, Sharma did not directly name Rahul Gandhi but referred to comments made by individuals in high positions who have labeled Hindus as violent. She contended that such statements should be viewed as part of a larger conspiracy to undermine the Sanatania community. “When people in high positions say that Hindus are violent or when some others say that the Sanatanias are eliminated, then that conspiracy should be understood,” she stated.

Sharma emphasized that if Hindus were truly violent, she would not need to live under such tight security in her own country. **“If Hindu had been violent, a Hindu daughter in her own country would not have to live in such a security circle,”** she asserted, highlighting the irony and danger she feels as a prominent Hindu figure under constant threat.

She also took a stand on the broader issue of law and order, stating, “Our country will run according to its constitution, not according to any Mazhabi or Sharia law.” This remark underscored her belief in the supremacy of the Indian Constitution over any religious legal frameworks.

Nupur Sharma’s return to the public eye and her bold statements reflect her continuing influence and the unresolved tensions surrounding religious and political discourse in India. Her remarks have once again ignited debates on freedom of speech, religious tolerance, and the role of political leaders in shaping these narratives.

This event marks a significant moment in Sharma’s career, as she reasserts her position and perspectives amidst ongoing controversies and security concerns. Her speech at the Bhagwat Katha in Ghaziabad is likely to resonate with many of her supporters and detractors alike, bringing her back into the spotlight of Indian politics and social commentary.
