# Joby Aviation to Launch Flying Taxi Service in Dubai Ahead of US

*Dubai, March 23, 2024* — Joby Aviation Inc., a pioneering company in the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft industry, is set to revolutionize urban transportation with its ambitious flying taxi service. The company recently announced that it expects to **launch its air taxi operations in Dubai before any other location**, including its home base in the United States.

## A New Era of Urban Mobility

### The Vision

Joby Aviation envisions a future where commuters can soar above traffic-clogged streets, bypassing congestion and reaching their destinations swiftly. Their electric air taxis promise to transform the way people move within cities, making daily commutes more efficient, eco-friendly, and convenient.

### Dubai: The Pioneering Destination

Dubai, known for its futuristic skyline and innovative spirit, has embraced Joby Aviation's vision. The company has forged a strategic partnership with the Gulf emirate, and the progress in Dubai is "a bit more advanced in the approach they're taking" compared to other jurisdictions, according to Bonny Simi, Joby's President of Operations. As a result, Dubai will be the first city to experience Joby's flying taxi service.

### Key Milestones

1. **Initial Operations by 2025**: Joby aims to kick off its air taxi services in Dubai by 2025. The city's commitment to cutting-edge technology and its forward-thinking regulatory environment have facilitated this accelerated timeline.

2. **Exclusive Agreement**: Joby secured a six-year exclusive agreement with Dubai to operate its electric air taxis. This agreement provides a solid foundation for the company's expansion in the region.

3. **Vertiports Across Dubai**: Joby plans to establish four vertiports across Dubai, strategically located to serve different areas:
    - **Dubai International Airport**: A global hub for air travel.
    - **Palm Jumeirah**: The iconic man-made island.
    - **Downtown Dubai**: Near the Burj Khalifa tower.
    - **Dubai Marina**: A bustling area known for its waterfront views.

4. **Financial Support**: Dubai's government has extended economic support to Joby, while regulators have dedicated resources to expedite the launch. This collaboration aims to "de-risk the initial launch" financially, ensuring a smooth start for the flying taxi service.

### Rivalry and Regional Expansion

While Joby will have exclusivity for flights within Dubai, rival company Archer Aviation Inc. has reached a preliminary deal with nearby Abu Dhabi. Archer plans to operate flights between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as well as across the United Arab Emirates. Other eVTOL companies, including Lilium NV, Embraer SA's Eve Air Mobility, and Volocopter GmbH, have also set their sights on the oil-rich Gulf states.

Dubai's skies are poised to witness a historic transformation as Joby Aviation prepares to launch its electric air taxis. Commuters and tourists alike eagerly await the day when they can hail a flying taxi and soar above the city's iconic landmarks.
