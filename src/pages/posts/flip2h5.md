## Do KFC even offers veg food in their new restaurant?

Certainly! KFC offers a variety of **vegetarian and vegan options**. Let me share the details with you:

1. **KFC Vegan Burger**: This burger features a **Quorn chicken fillet** coated in KFC's iconic herbs and spices mix. It's served with iceberg lettuce and vegan mayonnaise, all within a soft-glazed bun. You can find it at over **900 KFC restaurants** across the country and for delivery via platforms like **Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Uber Eats**²⁵.
