### Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh Killed in Tehran Strike

**Tehran, Iran** – In a significant development, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards were killed in what the Palestinian group has described as a "treacherous Zionist raid" on his residence in Tehran. The attack took place on Tuesday morning, according to a statement released by Hamas today.

Haniyeh was in the Iranian capital to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Following the inauguration, he had meetings scheduled with President Pezeshkian and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“Brother, leader, mujahid Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the movement, died in a Zionist strike on his headquarters in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of the new (Iranian) president,” the statement from Hamas read.

Iranian authorities have confirmed the incident and announced that an investigation is underway to uncover more details about the attack. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) corroborated the occurrence, with a statement on their Sepah news website declaring: “The residence of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political office of Hamas Islamic Resistance, was hit in Tehran, and as a result of this incident, him and one of his bodyguards were martyred.”

The IRGC confirmed Haniyeh’s death and indicated that his Tehran residence was specifically targeted. The group reiterated their commitment to investigating the attack and bringing those responsible to justice.

This event marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, with potential wide-reaching implications for regional stability. Haniyeh’s presence in Tehran was part of a broader effort to strengthen ties between Hamas and the Iranian leadership, underscoring the strategic alliances in the region.

Further details and reactions from international stakeholders are expected as the investigation progresses.
