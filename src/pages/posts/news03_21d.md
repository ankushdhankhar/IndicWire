# Adoption Trends in India: A Gender-Sensitive Perspective

## Abstract
Child adoption is a complex and multifaceted process that reflects the sociocultural dynamics of Indian society. While adoption has a long history in India, it is not without its challenges, especially when it comes to gender aspects. This report explores gender-based adoption trends in India, highlighting the complex interaction of cultural, economic, and social factors that influence adoption decisions. By analyzing adoption records, we reveal how gender shapes adoption preferences, practices, and outcomes. We examine the prevalence of male and female child adoption, the reasons behind such preferences, and the consequences of these choices on the adopted children and adopting families. The research findings underscore significant gender disparities in adoption patterns, with male children being more likely to be adopted than their female counterparts. This report provides a comprehensive overview of gender-sensitive adoption in India, addressing complexities, challenges, and opportunities within the adoption process.

## Introduction
Child adoption, deeply rooted in the socio-cultural fabric of any society, reflects not only the values and beliefs of that society but also family and identity formation dynamics. In India's diverse and culturally rich landscape, adoption is a centuries-old tradition driven by compassion, social harmony, and the desire to provide children with a loving environment. However, when viewed through a gender lens, adoption reveals a nuanced and often troubling landscape characterized by deep-seated biases and imbalances. Gender-based adoption trends in India invite critical consideration beyond mere statistics.

## Gender Disparities in Adoption Patterns
1. **Prevalence of Male and Female Child Adoption**:
   - Over the past five years, adoption figures compiled by the Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) indicate a significant shift in adoption preferences.
   - On average, **59.77% of adopting parents chose girls**, while **40.23% preferred boys**.
   - The state of **Maharashtra** leads in adoption rates, followed by **Karnataka** and **West Bengal**.
   - During the 2017-18 period, out of **3,276 adopted children across India**, **1,858 were girls**, underscoring a marked preference for adopting female children.

2. **Factors Influencing Adoption Preferences**:
   - **Cultural Biases**: Traditional beliefs associating sons with performing final rites for parents contribute to the preference for male children.
   - **Economic Considerations**: Families may perceive raising girls as more expensive due to dowry-related expenses.
   - **Social Norms**: Societal expectations and stereotypes play a role in shaping adoption choices.

3. **Autonomy of Prospective Parents**:
   - Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Kumar, CEO of CARA, emphasizes that prospective parents have the autonomy to choose the gender of the child they wish to adopt.
   - Despite lower male-female ratios in states like **Haryana** and **Uttar Pradesh**, there remains a clear preference for adopting girls.

## Implications and Opportunities
1. **Challenges**:
   - **Gender Imbalance**: The skewed adoption pattern perpetuates gender disparities.
   - **Stereotypes**: Challenging societal norms and stereotypes is essential to promote gender-neutral adoption.

2. **Opportunities**:
   - **Awareness Campaigns**: Educating prospective parents about the importance of gender-neutral adoption.
   - **Legal Reforms**: Strengthening legal frameworks to ensure equal opportunities for male and female children.
   - **Support Systems**: Providing support to adopting families irrespective of the child's gender.

## Conclusion
Gender-sensitive adoption in India is a multifaceted issue that requires concerted efforts from policymakers, adoption agencies, and society at large. By addressing gender disparities, we contribute to the broader debate on gender equality and children's rights. Adoption should be about providing a loving home to all children, regardless of their gender. Let us strive for a more inclusive and compassionate adoption landscape in India.
