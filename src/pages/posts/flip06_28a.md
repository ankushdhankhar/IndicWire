## Blaming neighboring states is not a solution, it's high time the government takes responsibility

**New Delhi, June 28, 2024** â€” As Delhi grapples with severe water shortages, questions are being raised about the government's efforts to implement effective water management solutions. Despite the recurring crises, mandatory rainwater harvesting has not yet been enforced in the national capital, leading to widespread criticism and debate.

### Current Water Crisis

Delhi's water woes are not new, with the city frequently facing water shortages, especially during the summer months. The recent spell of heavy rainfall, while causing severe waterlogging, has also highlighted the potential of rainwater harvesting as a solution to the city's water scarcity problems. 

Residents and environmental activists argue that the government should have long implemented mandatory rainwater harvesting systems to harness the rainwater, especially during the monsoon season. They believe this could significantly alleviate the water shortage issues the city faces annually.

### Government's Stance

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has often attributed Delhi's water shortages to inadequate water supply from neighboring states, particularly Haryana. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly claimed that Haryana's failure to release sufficient water to Delhi is a major factor contributing to the crisis.

However, critics argue that relying solely on external sources for water supply is unsustainable. They point out that the government should focus on improving internal water management systems, including the implementation of rainwater harvesting.

### Lack of Policy Implementation

Although the Delhi government has promoted rainwater harvesting through various initiatives and incentives, there has been no move to make it mandatory for residential and commercial buildings. Experts believe that a compulsory rainwater harvesting policy could have multiple benefits, such as reducing dependence on external water sources, mitigating urban flooding, and replenishing groundwater levels.

Dr. Rakesh Kumar, an environmental scientist, stated, "Rainwater harvesting is a low-cost, high-impact solution that can greatly enhance Delhi's water security. Making it mandatory would ensure widespread adoption and long-term benefits for the city's water management."

### Public Opinion and Activism

Public opinion is increasingly favoring mandatory rainwater harvesting. Many residents feel that the government needs to take proactive measures rather than blaming external factors for the water crisis. Environmental groups and activists are urging the government to pass legislation that would require all new constructions and existing buildings to install rainwater harvesting systems.

Rajesh Sharma, a local activist, commented, "It's high time the government takes responsibility and implements effective measures like rainwater harvesting. Blaming neighboring states is not a solution. We need sustainable practices to secure our water future."

### The Way Forward

The Delhi government has acknowledged the need for better water management practices and has promised to consider more stringent measures. However, concrete steps towards mandatory rainwater harvesting are yet to be taken.

As the city continues to face water challenges, the implementation of mandatory rainwater harvesting could be a crucial step in addressing the crisis. With proper policy and enforcement, Delhi can make significant strides towards becoming a more water-secure city.

For the latest updates on water management policies and initiatives, citizens are encouraged to follow official channels and participate in public consultations.
