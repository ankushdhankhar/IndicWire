**Controversy Over Oath-Taking Slogans Deepens in Parliament:**

The ongoing session of Parliament has been rocked by controversy over the slogans chosen by newly elected MPs during their oath-taking ceremonies. The issue first arose when AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi concluded his oath with the slogan "Jai Palestine," drawing criticism from BJP leaders who accused him of violating parliamentary norms.

Union Minister G Kishan Reddy condemned Owaisi's choice, stating, "The slogan 'Jai Palestine' given by AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi in Parliament today is absolutely wrong. This is against the rules of the House." Reddy emphasized that MPs are expected to conclude their oaths with traditional slogans such as "Bharat Mata ki Jai."

In response, Owaisi defended his action, arguing that it was constitutionally permissible. "How is it against [the rules]? Show the provision in the Constitution," he challenged. Owaisi asserted that his choice of slogans, which also included "Jai Bheem" and "Jai Telangana," reflected his commitment to various causes and did not violate any parliamentary regulations.

The controversy intensified when BJP MP Chhatrapal Singh Gangwar used the slogans "Jai Hindu Rashtra, Jai Bharat" during his oath ceremony on the following day. This sparked immediate outcry from opposition parties, who criticized the statements as divisive and contrary to the secular principles of the Constitution.

Opposition MPs argued that using religious or nationalist slogans during oath-taking ceremonies undermined the inclusive ethos of India's parliamentary democracy. They called for adherence to a secular and pluralistic approach that respects the diversity of beliefs and identities within the country.

As the debate rages on, the contrasting slogans used by MPs have reignited discussions about nationalism, constitutional values, and the appropriate conduct of elected representatives in Parliament. The controversy underscores the ongoing tension between expressions of identity and the imperative to uphold parliamentary decorum and unity.
