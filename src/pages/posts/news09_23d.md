**Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi Criticizes Secularism as a "European Concept," Claims It Is Unnecessary in India**

**Chennai, September 23, 2024** — Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi sparked a fresh debate over secularism during a public event in Chennai on Sunday, labeling it a "European concept" and suggesting that India does not need such a framework. His remarks have drawn strong reactions across the political spectrum.

Speaking at a function organized by a cultural organization, Governor Ravi stated, "A lot of frauds have been committed on the people of this country, and one of them is that they have tried to give a wrong interpretation of secularism." He elaborated that the concept of secularism, as practiced in India, was a distortion of its original European meaning and that its imposition on Indian society was misleading.

Ravi emphasized that India has traditionally embraced all religions and cultures, making it inherently inclusive. "We don't need secularism to tell us how to respect or accommodate others," he said, citing India's ancient civilization, which predates the European Enlightenment. According to him, India’s history of tolerance and pluralism should be enough to guide its governance and social principles.

### Political Reactions

Governor Ravi's comments have drawn significant criticism, especially from opposition parties and various civil society groups, who view secularism as an essential pillar of India’s Constitution. Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK party condemned the governor’s statement, with Chief Minister MK Stalin saying, "The Indian Constitution is built on secular values that protect the rights of all religions. The governor’s remarks are not only irresponsible but dangerous."

Several political leaders across India have also weighed in on the controversy. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh remarked, "It is troubling when a constitutional figure like a governor speaks against secularism, a principle that has kept our diverse country united."

Meanwhile, supporters of the governor argue that his speech highlighted a deeper concern about the way secularism has been implemented in India. Some members of right-wing groups have voiced support for his statement, claiming that secularism has often been misused for political purposes.

### Historical Context of Secularism in India

Secularism, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution, is a core value that guarantees equal respect for all religions, without favoring any one group. However, the interpretation and application of secularism have long been debated in Indian politics, with some arguing that the concept has been manipulated for vote-bank politics.

RN Ravi's remarks have reopened the debate on the nature and relevance of secularism in a country as diverse as India, where multiple religious communities coexist. His stance that secularism is a "European import" reflects an ongoing critique among certain sections of society who believe that India's unique religious and cultural landscape cannot be governed by Western ideas.

### Conclusion

As Governor Ravi’s remarks continue to stir discussion, it remains to be seen how this will impact the broader debate over India's identity and the role of secularism in its governance. For now, his comments have intensified political fault lines, particularly in a state like Tamil Nadu, known for its strong stance on secularism and social justice.

The controversy may lead to further discussions about the future of secularism in India, and whether its interpretation needs a revision in the context of India's civilizational values.
