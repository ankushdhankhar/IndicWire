**Himanta Biswa Sarma Condemns Mamata Banerjee's Remarks on Assam: "How Dare You Threaten Assam?"** 

**Date:** August 28, 2024

**Location:** Guwahati, Assam

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma fiercely criticized West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over her recent comments linking Assam to ongoing protests in Kolkata. Sarma expressed his outrage in response to Banerjee's controversial remark, where she referenced Assam while drawing a parallel between the protests in Kolkata and unrest in Bangladesh.

During a public address in Kolkata, Mamata Banerjee mentioned the escalating protests in the city and drew an analogy with the situation in Bangladesh, adding that Assam could face a similar fate. This statement was seen by many as a direct threat to the state of Assam, triggering a sharp response from its Chief Minister.

Himanta Biswa Sarma, known for his outspoken nature, responded to Banerjee's comment by questioning her intent and accusing her of making baseless threats against Assam. "How dare you threaten Assam? We are a peaceful state, and we will not tolerate any attempts to incite violence or unrest," Sarma stated in a press conference held in Guwahati.

Sarma further criticized Banerjee for dragging Assam into her political narrative and warned her against making any statements that could harm the state's reputation. "Assam is not a place for your political games. Our people have always upheld peace and harmony, and we will continue to do so," he asserted.

The Assam Chief Minister also called on Banerjee to focus on resolving the issues within her own state rather than involving other states in her rhetoric. "West Bengal is facing its own challenges, and the Chief Minister should concentrate on addressing those rather than making provocative statements about Assam," Sarma added.

Mamata Banerjee has not yet responded to Sarma's remarks, but the exchange has added another layer of tension between the two states, which have had a complex relationship historically. Political analysts suggest that this incident could further strain relations between the leaders, especially as both are known for their strong regional identities and assertive leadership styles.

The situation remains closely watched, with both supporters and critics weighing in on the exchange. As of now, no further escalation has been reported, but the political dynamics between Assam and West Bengal may continue to evolve in light of these developments.
