**Jailed Radical Preacher Amritpal Singh Granted Four-Day Parole to Take Oath as MP, Sparking Outrage** 

**New Delhi, July 5, 2024** â€“ In a controversial move that has ignited a firestorm of criticism, the Indian government has granted four-day parole to jailed radical preacher Amritpal Singh, enabling him to take the oath as a Member of Parliament. Singh, who has been incarcerated on charges of incitement and fostering communal unrest, will be released on Friday to fulfill his parliamentary duties.

Amritpal Singh's release has been met with widespread condemnation from political analysts, human rights activists, and the general public. Critics argue that allowing a person with a notorious record of promoting radical ideologies and disrupting social harmony to assume a significant public office undermines the integrity of the democratic process.

### Background

Amritpal Singh, a prominent figure in radical religious circles, was arrested last year after a series of inflammatory speeches and actions that were deemed a threat to national security. His rhetoric, which often incited violence and division among different communities, led to widespread unrest and numerous violent incidents across the country. Despite his controversial past, Singh managed to secure a parliamentary seat in the recent elections, raising eyebrows and concerns about the political landscape in India.

### Government's Stance

The government's decision to grant Singh parole is being justified on the grounds of democratic norms and legal obligations. According to officials, denying an elected representative the opportunity to take their oath would set a dangerous precedent and violate the principles of parliamentary democracy. However, this rationale has done little to quell the growing discontent among various sections of society.

### Public and Political Reaction

Opposition parties have been quick to condemn the decision, accusing the ruling government of pandering to extremist elements for political gain. "This move sends a dangerous message that those who preach hate and division can still hold positions of power in our democracy," said a senior opposition leader. Human rights organizations have also voiced their concerns, stating that Singh's release poses a direct threat to communal harmony and public safety.

The general public has expressed outrage on social media platforms, with hashtags like #NoToRadicalMP and #JusticeForVictims trending nationwide. Many citizens feel that allowing Singh to take the oath as an MP not only legitimizes his extremist views but also emboldens other radical elements to seek political office.

### Legal and Ethical Concerns

Legal experts have raised questions about the ethical implications of Singh's parole. "While the law may permit his temporary release, it is crucial to consider the broader impact on society and the message it sends about our commitment to combating extremism," said a renowned legal scholar. The decision has also sparked a debate about the need for stricter eligibility criteria for parliamentary candidates, particularly concerning their criminal records and ideological stances.

### Conclusion

The temporary release of Amritpal Singh to take his oath as a Member of Parliament has undeniably stirred a hornet's nest. As the nation grapples with the implications of this decision, it remains to be seen how this episode will influence the future of Indian politics and the ongoing struggle to maintain communal harmony. Critics argue that the government's move is a dangerous gamble that could have far-reaching consequences for the country's democratic fabric and social stability.
