### UPSC Cancels Selection of Trainee IAS Officer Puja Khedkar Over Fraud Allegations

**New Delhi, July 20, 2024** â€” In a significant development, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has issued a notice canceling the selection of trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar. This decision comes amid serious allegations that Ms. Khedkar falsified information regarding her visual and mental disabilities and misrepresented her identity to clear the Civil Services entrance exam.

A notification released on Friday afternoon detailed the accusations against the 23-year-old officer. It stated that Ms. Khedkar "fraudulently availed attempts beyond the permissible limit" and that the UPSC had "initiated a series of actions against her."

According to sources, Ms. Khedkar is alleged to have fabricated her disability status, allowing her additional attempts and relaxations under the Civil Services Examination rules. Furthermore, it is claimed that she altered the names of her parents to support her false identity during the application process.

The UPSC, which conducts the prestigious Civil Services Examination, views these allegations as a grave violation of the exam's integrity and the principles of fairness and transparency. The Commission has expressed its commitment to upholding the sanctity of the examination process and ensuring that only deserving candidates are selected.

The notice from the UPSC emphasized the severity of Ms. Khedkar's actions, stating, "Such fraudulent practices not only undermine the merit-based selection process but also compromise the trust placed in the Commission by the public."

In light of these findings, the UPSC has nullified Ms. Khedkar's selection and taken steps to prevent such incidents in the future. The Commission is expected to conduct a thorough review of its verification procedures to enhance the detection of fraudulent activities.

Ms. Khedkar's case has sparked widespread discussion about the stringent measures needed to safeguard the integrity of competitive examinations in India. The Civil Services Examination is one of the most challenging and respected exams in the country, with thousands of aspirants vying for a limited number of positions in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), and Indian Police Service (IPS), among others.

As the investigation continues, the UPSC has reassured the public that it will take all necessary actions to maintain the credibility of the Civil Services Examination and ensure that such violations are met with strict consequences.

For now, the focus remains on restoring trust in the examination process and reinforcing the values of honesty and integrity that are foundational to the Civil Services in India.
