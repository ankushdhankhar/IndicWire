### **Udaipur Stabbing: Communal Tensions Erupt as Victim's Family Stages Protest**

*Udaipur, Rajasthan, August 18, 2024* — The family of a 15-year-old Hindu boy, who was recently stabbed by his classmate on the premises of a government school in Udaipur, staged a protest on Sunday amid rising communal tensions in the city. The incident, which occurred during school hours on Friday, has sparked outrage in the community, with the victim’s family alleging that they were not allowed to visit the boy at the hospital, a claim that the police have denied.

The incident took place at a government school in Udaipur when the accused, a 15-year-old Muslim student, allegedly stabbed his classmate with a dagger he had brought to school. The motive behind the attack is still under investigation, but the communal overtones of the case have heightened tensions in the area.

The victim, who sustained serious injuries, was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. His condition remains critical, according to hospital authorities. The family of the victim has expressed their frustration and anger, claiming they were barred from seeing their son in the hospital, an allegation that the police have refuted.

"We were desperate to see our son, to be with him during this critical time, but the authorities did not allow us to meet him," said a family member. "We feel completely helpless."

In response, the local police have ramped up security in the area to prevent any escalation of violence. Additional security personnel have been deployed around the school and the hospital to maintain law and order.

"The situation is under control," said a senior police officer. "We are investigating the incident thoroughly, and both the accused and his father have been detained for questioning. We are also ensuring that there is no further communal tension in the city."

The stabbing incident has ignited fears of communal violence, with community leaders from both sides calling for peace and calm. "This is a tragic incident, but we must not allow it to divide our communities," said a local leader. "Violence is never the answer."

As the investigation continues, authorities are urging residents to refrain from spreading rumors and to cooperate with law enforcement to ensure the safety and harmony of the community. The victim’s family has called for swift justice, while the city of Udaipur remains on edge, hoping for a peaceful resolution to the tensions that have arisen from this tragic event.
