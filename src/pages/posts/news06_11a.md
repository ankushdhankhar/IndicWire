**UGC Greenlights Biannual Admissions for Indian Universities, Aligning with Global Standards**

*June 11, 2024*

In a landmark decision aimed at enhancing flexibility and accessibility in higher education, the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India has given the green light to Indian universities and higher education institutions to conduct admissions twice a year. This move brings Indian academia in line with global standards and practices observed by many renowned foreign universities.

The announcement came from UGC Chief Jagadesh Kumar, who revealed that starting from the upcoming 2024-25 academic session, Indian universities will be able to enroll students during two distinct cycles. The first cycle will take place in July-August, while the second will occur in January-February. This significant development is set to revolutionize the traditional admission process prevalent in Indian higher education.

The UGC's approval of this proposal marks a significant departure from the traditional annual admission system prevalent across most Indian educational institutions. Under the new framework, students aspiring to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate degrees will have the opportunity to seek admission twice within a single academic year, providing them with greater flexibility and multiple entry points into higher education.

Explaining the rationale behind the decision, UGC officials emphasized the need to adapt to evolving educational paradigms and cater to the diverse needs and aspirations of students. By adopting a biannual admissions system, universities can accommodate a broader spectrum of learners, including those who may have missed the conventional admission cycle due to various reasons.

Furthermore, this move is expected to mitigate the intense competition and the high-stakes pressure associated with the traditional single-window admission process. By spreading admissions across two cycles, institutions can potentially reduce the burden on students and minimize the adverse effects of cut-throat competition on mental health and well-being.

The biannual admission system is anticipated to foster greater inclusivity and diversity within Indian higher education by attracting a more varied pool of applicants. Moreover, it aligns with the global trend observed in several reputed universities abroad, where multiple intake sessions are a common practice.

While the implementation details are yet to be finalized, the UGC has encouraged universities to proactively prepare for the transition to the biannual admission system. Institutions are expected to streamline their admission processes, including the scheduling of entrance examinations, counseling sessions, and other related procedures, to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.

Education experts and stakeholders have welcomed the UGC's decision, viewing it as a progressive step towards modernizing India's higher education landscape and making it more responsive to the evolving needs of students and society at large. They believe that the biannual admission system will not only enhance accessibility and inclusivity but also foster innovation and excellence in academic pursuits.

As Indian universities gear up to embrace this transformative change, the UGC remains committed to providing necessary guidance and support to facilitate the successful implementation of the biannual admission system across the country. With this paradigm shift, India's higher education sector is poised to embark on a new era of growth and development, driven by a commitment to equity, excellence, and student-centricity.
