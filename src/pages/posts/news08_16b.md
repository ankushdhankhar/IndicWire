### Why The West Bengal Police, Under Mamta Administration, Did Not Take Immediate And Decisive Action When The Crime Was First Reported

#### CM Mamata Banerjee Joins Protests Amidst Controversy Over Handling of Horrific Rape Case of 35-Year-Old Doctor Trainee

**Kolkata, August 16, 2024**: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has joined public protestors demanding justice following the brutal rape of a 35-year-old doctor trainee at MD Kar Medical College and Hospital. The case, which has shocked the state and ignited widespread outrage, has taken a contentious turn with allegations of evidence tampering and administrative negligence.

#### **The Incident: A Trainee Doctor’s Nightmare**

The victim, a 35-year-old doctor trainee at MD Kar Medical College and Hospital, was on duty when she was brutally assaulted within the hospital premises on the night of August 10, 2024. The doctor trainee was found in a critical condition in one of the isolated rooms within the hospital, having been subjected to severe physical and sexual violence. Initial reports indicated that she was left unconscious and had sustained multiple injuries.

As the news of the assault broke, there was an immediate public outcry, particularly from the medical community, which demanded swift action against the perpetrators and a thorough investigation into the security lapses that allowed such a heinous crime to occur within a medical institution.

#### **Allegations of Evidence Tampering and Administrative Failures**

The investigation into the assault quickly became mired in controversy as allegations surfaced that crucial evidence was being tampered with. It was reported that CCTV footage from the hospital, which could have been instrumental in identifying the assailants, had been deleted or was otherwise rendered inaccessible. Additionally, forensic evidence, including the victim’s clothing and other critical items, was allegedly mishandled or destroyed, raising suspicions of a cover-up.

These allegations have been directed at both the hospital administration and local authorities, with accusations that individuals linked to local goons were involved in the manipulation of evidence. The victim’s family and several activists have pointed fingers at the state government, questioning why stronger measures were not taken to secure the crime scene and preserve evidence.

#### **Chief Minister's Response and Public Outrage**

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to join the protests has sparked mixed reactions. While her involvement has been seen by some as a gesture of solidarity with the victim and her family, others have criticized the timing of her actions, arguing that she should have intervened earlier to prevent the alleged tampering of evidence.

Critics have questioned why the West Bengal Police, under her administration, did not take immediate and decisive action when the crime was first reported. There are widespread concerns that the state’s response was too slow, allowing crucial evidence to be destroyed, which could jeopardize the chances of securing justice for the victim.

#### **The Court's Intervention and CBI Involvement**

Amidst the growing outcry and allegations of a botched investigation, the Calcutta High Court stepped in, transferring the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The court’s decision was based on the apparent mishandling of the case by local authorities and the need for an impartial and thorough investigation.

The CBI’s involvement has been welcomed by many who believe that only an independent probe can uncover the truth and ensure that the culprits are brought to justice. However, the state government has expressed its displeasure with the court’s decision, with some TMC leaders accusing the central government of using the CBI for political purposes.

#### **Political Implications and Public Sentiment**

The horrific nature of the crime, coupled with the allegations of a cover-up, has led to widespread public anger. Mamata Banerjee’s late entry into the protests has raised questions about her leadership and the state government’s commitment to protecting women and ensuring law and order.

Opposition parties have seized on the incident to criticize the TMC government, with the BJP accusing Mamata Banerjee of failing to protect women in the state and allowing a culture of impunity to take root. The political fallout from this case is likely to be significant, particularly with the state assembly elections approaching.

#### **Conclusion**

The rape of the 35-year-old doctor trainee at MD Kar Medical College and Hospital has not only exposed serious flaws in the security and administrative systems within the institution but has also raised troubling questions about the state government’s handling of the case. As the CBI takes over the investigation, the people of West Bengal will be watching closely, demanding answers and, above all, justice for the victim.
