**Arvind Kejriwal: Will Accept CM Post Only If People Certify His Honesty in Upcoming Elections**

**New Delhi, September 15, 2024** – In a bold declaration, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that he would only assume the post of chief minister again if the people of Delhi affirm his honesty in the upcoming assembly elections. Addressing a gathering, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said, “We will go to the court of the people to prove our innocence. If the people believe in my integrity and our governance, I will accept the responsibility of leading Delhi once more."

Kejriwal's statement comes at a time when his government has faced both praise for welfare schemes and criticism over issues like air pollution and allegations of corruption. Emphasizing the role of the electorate, he made it clear that his political future depends on public trust.

### "Court of the People"
The reference to the “court of the people” underscores Kejriwal’s belief in the power of democracy to validate or question a leader’s conduct. By framing the upcoming election as a referendum on his honesty, Kejriwal is signaling his readiness to be held accountable by the people, rather than his political adversaries.

This approach aims to rally his supporters while deflecting criticism from the opposition, who have accused his administration of corruption and mismanagement. Kejriwal's call for public certification of his honesty is likely to sharpen the election narrative around his personal integrity and his party's governance record.

### Opposition’s Criticism
Kejriwal’s statement has drawn sharp reactions from opposition parties. The BJP and Congress have both accused AAP of dodging accountability, questioning the sincerity of Kejriwal's claims of transparency. BJP spokespersons argue that “proving honesty in the court of law is what matters,” while Congress leaders have pointed to ongoing controversies as proof that the AAP government has not delivered on its promises.
