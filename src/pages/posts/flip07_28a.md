### Protests Intensify: Calls for Inquiry and Action Against Corruption by the Delhi government and MCD 

**New Delhi, July 28, 2024** â€“ The tragic flooding at Rau's IAS Coaching Centre in Old Rajender Nagar, Delhi, which claimed the lives of three UPSC aspirants, has sparked widespread protests and demands for a thorough investigation into the alleged corruption and negligence by the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).

#### Call for Investigation

Protesters and student organizations are calling for an immediate and comprehensive inquiry into the alleged corruption involving Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Education Minister Atishi, and their administration. They also demand an investigation into the MCD's failure to maintain and clean the drainage systems, which exacerbated the flooding situation.

One protester, Anil Sharma, voiced the frustrations of many: "There should be an inquiry into the corruption of Arvind Kejriwal, Atishi, and their government. The Delhi Municipal Corporation's corruption should be thoroughly investigated. We need to know why the drainage system was not cleaned despite repeated issues."

#### Illegal Operations and Basement Safety

A significant focus of the protests has been the "illegal" operation of libraries and coaching centers in basements. Protesters are calling for an immediate halt to such practices, citing the inherent dangers during heavy rains. The basement of Rau's IAS Coaching Centre, where the fatal incident occurred, lacked proper drainage and safety measures.

Another student, Ritu Mehta, highlighted the broader issue: "Eighty percent of libraries here are in basements. Water accumulates within 10 minutes of rainfall. The MCD has not taken any action on this. We need a complete stop to illegal basement operations to ensure student safety."

#### Criticism of MCD's Response

Protesters criticized the MCD's lack of action and accountability, pointing out that despite previous incidents of severe waterlogging, no significant measures have been taken. "Last time when it rained, cars were floating. In one year, they haven't done anything," said a protester. "No senior official has visited this place till now. The MCD must address these issues immediately."

#### Official Responses

The Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Education Minister Atishi have faced mounting pressure to respond to the accusations. In a brief statement, Kejriwal expressed condolences to the families but did not address the calls for an inquiry into the alleged corruption.

The MCD, on the other hand, announced plans to conduct inspections of all basement operations in educational institutions and other establishments. "We will ensure that all such establishments comply with safety norms and regulations to prevent future tragedies," said an MCD spokesperson.

#### Community and Student Support

The local community and student bodies have continued to show solidarity with the victims' families and the protestors. Vigils and demonstrations are being held, with a focus on demanding accountability and systemic change to prevent such incidents.

As the protests continue, the call for transparency and action against corruption and negligence grows louder. The tragic incident at Rau's IAS Coaching Centre has not only highlighted the immediate need for safety measures but also ignited a broader movement for accountability and justice in Delhi.
