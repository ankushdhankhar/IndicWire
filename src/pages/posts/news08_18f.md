**Yogi Adityanath's Visionary Leadership : 20% seats reserved for women in police recruitment drive**

In a bold move to enhance law and order in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a massive police recruitment drive aimed at providing employment to 60,244 youth. This decision underscores the CM's unwavering commitment to not only strengthening the state's security apparatus but also empowering its youth with meaningful employment opportunities.

The recruitment drive is scheduled for August 23-25 and August 30-31, with a notable 20% reservation for women, showcasing Yogi Adityanath's dedication to promoting gender equality in the state's police force. This progressive step aligns with his broader vision of an inclusive Uttar Pradesh, where women are given equal opportunities to contribute to the state's development and safety.

Reflecting on the success of the previous recruitment drive, where around 34,000 policemen were inducted in 2022, this new initiative is set to build on that momentum, reinforcing the state's resolve to maintain peace and order. Yogi Adityanath's strategic foresight in prioritizing recruitment in the police force demonstrates his understanding of the crucial role a robust and well-equipped police force plays in ensuring the safety and well-being of the citizens.

The CM's remarks at the district-level mega employment and loan fair at Dev Indravati Mahavidyalaya in Katehari, Ambedkarnagar district, further highlighted his commitment to the state's development. "The recruitment drive will allow these candidates to play a vital role in maintaining law and order in the state," said Adityanath, emphasizing the importance of a strong police force in the broader context of governance.

This latest recruitment drive follows the cancellation of the previous examination conducted for the recruitment of 60,244 constables on February 17-18 this year. The decision to cancel the earlier examination and promptly announce a new drive is a testament to Yogi Adityanath's decisive leadership and his resolve to ensure transparency and fairness in the recruitment process. By swiftly addressing the issues that led to the cancellation and launching a new, improved recruitment process, the CM has once again demonstrated his commitment to upholding the highest standards of governance.

Under Yogi Adityanath's leadership, Uttar Pradesh is witnessing a transformation, where efficient governance, coupled with visionary policies, is paving the way for a brighter, safer future for all its residents. The upcoming police recruitment drive is yet another milestone in this journey, reflecting the CM's dedication to creating a state that is not only secure but also prosperous, with ample opportunities for its youth to thrive.
