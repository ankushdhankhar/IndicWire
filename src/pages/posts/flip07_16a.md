### Historic Reopening of Puri's Ratna Bhandar After 46 Years

**Puri, Odisha** – In a significant and historic event, the Ratna Bhandar, the highly secretive treasury of the 12th Century Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, was reopened on Sunday after being sealed for 46 years. This event coincided with the ongoing Rath Yatra festival that began on July 7, drawing heightened attention and curiosity.

**Divine Blessings and Decision Making**
The decision to reopen the Ratna Bhandar was made with the blessings of deities Goddess Bimala, Goddess Laxmi, and Lord Lokanath, who are revered as the custodians of the treasury. This was confirmed by committee chairman Justice Biswanath Rath. An 11-member team from the state government was granted access to the temple’s treasury, although no immediate inventory of the valuables was conducted.

**Oversight and Management**
The temple's management committee, chaired by the titular ‘King of Puri’ Dibyasingha Deb, and comprising selected members appointed by the Odisha government, is responsible for the safety and security of the Ratna Bhandar. The reopening has sparked widespread interest due to the vast collection of treasures it houses, including rare and priceless jewelry made from diamonds, gold, and other precious gems, many of which were donated by historical figures like King Anangabhima Dev.

**Treasures of the Ratna Bhandar**
The inner chamber, known as 'Bhitara Bhandar,' is reputed to contain a staggering 180 types of ornaments, including 74 varieties of pure gold items and over 140 pieces of silver jewelry. Additionally, it holds gold and diamond plates, ancient coins, and other valuables. The last inventory conducted in 1978 revealed an extensive collection of gold and silver ornaments. However, a subsequent entry into the treasury in 1985 for gold repairs did not result in an updated inventory, leaving many to speculate about the current contents and condition of the treasury.

**Challenges and Precautions**
The process of reopening the Ratna Bhandar required careful planning, including selecting an auspicious time. Given past issues with missing keys, there was a possibility of breaking the lock under the supervision of a magistrate. Concerns about potential serpents within the vault led to the hiring of a skilled snake charmer and the presence of medical teams on standby.

**Digital Catalog and Political Implications**
The recent reopening has been meticulously recorded and is expected to contribute to a digital catalog of the temple’s treasures. This move also aligns with one of the main election promises made by the BJP before winning the Odisha polls, further adding a layer of political significance to the event.

**Public Fascination and Future Plans**
The reopening of the Ratna Bhandar has captivated the public's imagination, with many intrigued by the legends and mysteries surrounding the vault's contents. As the inventory process progresses, it is anticipated that a comprehensive digital record will provide greater transparency and preservation of these invaluable treasures for future generations.

This historic event marks a pivotal moment for the Lord Jagannath Temple and its devotees, bridging the past and the present, and ensuring the continued reverence and protection of its ancient and priceless treasures.
