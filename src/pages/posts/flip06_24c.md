**Bajrang Punia to Return Padma Shri in Protest Over WFI Chief Election**

 In a bold and unprecedented move, renowned Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia has announced his decision to return the prestigious Padma Shri award, citing his discontent over the recent election of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief.

Punia, a celebrated athlete and recipient of numerous accolades, including the Padma Shri awarded to him in 2020, expressed his dissatisfaction with the election process that saw the incumbent chief being re-elected amidst allegations of irregularities and lack of transparency. The wrestler, known for his outspoken stance on issues affecting the sport, declared that he could not support an organization where fair governance and integrity were compromised.

The controversy surrounding the WFI chief election has been simmering for weeks, with various stakeholders within the wrestling community raising concerns about the conduct of the election and its implications for the sport's future in India. Punia's decision to relinquish the Padma Shri is seen as a symbolic gesture aimed at highlighting the need for accountability and reform within sports administration in the country.

In a statement released to the press, Bajrang Punia expressed his disappointment, saying, "I have always strived to uphold the values of fairness and honesty in my career. The recent events surrounding the WFI elections have deeply troubled me. As a mark of protest and in solidarity with the principles I believe in, I have decided to return the Padma Shri award."

The wrestler's decision has sparked a debate within the sports fraternity, with many athletes and supporters expressing solidarity with Punia's stand while others cautioning against such drastic measures. However, Punia remains resolute in his stance, emphasizing the importance of transparent and accountable leadership in sports governance.

The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports is yet to officially comment on Bajrang Punia's decision. Meanwhile, the WFI is facing mounting pressure to address the allegations and restore confidence in its leadership.

Bajrang Punia, known for his remarkable achievements on the mat and his unwavering commitment to the sport, has once again taken a bold step to advocate for integrity and fairness in Indian wrestling.
