### Church of End Time's Sale of 'Heavenly Land' Sparks Controversy

**Date:** June 27, 2024  
**Location:** Mexico

#### Introduction

A Christian church in Mexico, known as the Church of End Time, has recently made headlines for its unconventional and controversial fundraising strategy. The church is selling plots of land in what it claims to be ‘heaven,’ at a price starting at $100 per square meter. This novel approach has sparked widespread debate and raised ethical and legal questions.

#### The Sale of 'Heavenly Land'

The Church of End Time, led by Pastor Juan López, has been offering these plots since 2017. According to Pastor López, he received divine authorization from God to commence the sale. The church assures its followers that purchasing a plot of any size guarantees their place in heaven.

#### Payment Options and Popularity

To facilitate the purchases, the church has made various payment options available, including American Express, Apple Pay, and even installment plans. This flexibility has attracted a significant number of believers, leading to millions of dollars in revenue for the church.

Pastor López claims that the funds raised are used for the church’s charitable activities and community projects. However, the specifics of these expenditures remain unclear, leading to skepticism and criticism from various quarters.

#### Public Reaction and Controversy

The sale has ignited a mix of reactions. Supporters, mainly church members and loyal followers, view the purchase as an investment in their spiritual future. They believe that the plots symbolize their faith and dedication to securing a place in the afterlife.

Conversely, critics argue that the church is exploiting vulnerable believers. They accuse Pastor López of capitalizing on people's fears and hopes regarding the afterlife for financial gain. Legal experts are also questioning the legitimacy of the sales, suggesting that the church could be engaging in fraudulent activities.

#### Expert Opinions

Dr. Maria González, a theologian and professor of religious studies, commented on the matter: “The concept of selling land in heaven is not supported by any mainstream Christian doctrine. This practice raises serious theological and ethical concerns. It preys on the desperation of individuals seeking spiritual security.”

Meanwhile, legal analyst Ricardo Martínez noted, “While religious institutions often rely on donations and other forms of financial support, the sale of intangible, unverifiable assets like plots in heaven could be considered deceptive. Authorities may need to investigate whether this constitutes a form of financial fraud.”

#### Government and Legal Response

In light of the controversy, the Mexican government has initiated an investigation into the church's activities. Authorities are examining whether the sales breach any consumer protection laws or if there is any evidence of financial misconduct.

#### Conclusion

As the Church of End Time continues its operations, the debate over the sale of ‘heavenly land’ intensifies. This situation highlights the complex intersection of faith, ethics, and legality in modern religious practices. Whether this trend will continue or face legal intervention remains to be seen. In the meantime, the church's activities serve as a poignant reminder of the need for critical examination of religious and financial claims.
