**India Facilitating Communication Between Russia and Ukraine, Aiming for Peace: EAM Jaishankar**

*New Delhi, September 2024* – In a recent statement, India’s External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar emphasized India’s diplomatic role in fostering communication between Russia and Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict. According to Jaishankar, New Delhi has been sharing critical information between the two nations with the hope of contributing to peace efforts.

Jaishankar, speaking at an international forum, highlighted India’s unique position as one of the few countries with the diplomatic ability to engage with both sides. "There are not many countries or leaders who have the willingness or ability to engage both Russia and Ukraine simultaneously. India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, has consistently advocated dialogue and peaceful resolution of conflicts, and we are continuing to facilitate communication between both parties," said Jaishankar.

### India's Diplomatic Balance

India has maintained a neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, refraining from joining Western sanctions on Russia while expressing concern over the humanitarian impact of the war. Over the past few months, Indian diplomatic channels have been active in holding dialogues with both Russian and Ukrainian officials. This delicate balancing act has positioned India as a potential mediator.

Jaishankar reiterated that India's goal is to help end hostilities through peaceful negotiation, acknowledging the complexities of the conflict. He said, "Our efforts are rooted in India’s longstanding commitment to peace and stability, and we believe that this war needs to end sooner rather than later. Every step we take is with the intent of easing tensions."

### Global Peace Efforts and India's Role

In the international arena, there has been a growing call for more countries to step up efforts to mediate and de-escalate the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India’s continued engagement with both nations has been seen as an important part of the global peace effort, and the international community has recognized India’s potential role as a mediator.

Diplomats from various countries have praised India’s balanced approach. "India’s ability to maintain communication with both Russia and Ukraine is commendable. Not many countries can manage such a diplomatic feat in these turbulent times," remarked a senior European diplomat.

Jaishankar also referenced India’s prior efforts to de-escalate tensions, such as during the COVID-19 crisis, when New Delhi facilitated humanitarian aid to both sides. "Our actions are not new. India has always acted as a responsible global power, putting peace above partisanship."

### Future Peace Prospects

While Jaishankar did not provide specific details about the ongoing communications or future peace talks, he expressed optimism about India's ability to contribute positively. "There are some positive signs, but the road to peace is long and fraught with challenges. India will continue playing its role, sharing information, and building bridges where possible," he concluded.

As the conflict continues, India's efforts to maintain open channels of communication between Moscow and Kyiv may play a critical role in eventual peace talks. With both sides heavily entrenched in the war, the involvement of neutral parties like India could pave the way for constructive dialogue.
