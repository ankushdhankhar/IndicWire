**Karnataka Government Approves Bill for 100% Reservation for Kannadigas in Private Industries**

*Bengaluru, July 17, 2024* â€” In a significant move aimed at bolstering local employment, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announced that the state cabinet has approved a bill to grant 100 percent reservation to Kannadigas in private industries for C and D grade posts. The "Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024" is set to be tabled in the assembly on July 18.

### Key Provisions of the Bill

The bill mandates substantial quotas for local candidates in both management and non-management positions within industries, factories, and other establishments. Specifically, it stipulates:

- **50% Reservation in Management Categories**: Industries must appoint local candidates to at least half of the positions in management categories.
- **70% Reservation in Non-Management Categories**: A minimum of seventy percent of non-management roles must be filled by local candidates.

To ensure the effectiveness of these quotas, the bill includes several important provisions:

1. **Kannada Proficiency Requirement**: Candidates lacking a secondary school certificate with Kannada as a language must pass a Kannada proficiency test as specified by a designated nodal agency.
2. **Training Programs**: If qualified local candidates are unavailable, establishments must collaborate with the government or its agencies to train them within three years.
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Industries must regularly inform the nodal agency about their adherence to the act's provisions.
4. **Verification and Penalties**: The nodal agency is empowered to verify compliance reports and impose penalties ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 for any violations.

### Government's Stand

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah emphasized that the bill aims to address the unemployment issues faced by local youth and ensure that they benefit from the economic activities within the state. "This legislation is a crucial step towards empowering Kannadigas and providing them with more opportunities within their own state," he stated.

### Industry Response

The bill has sparked mixed reactions within the business community. While some industry leaders have expressed support for the initiative to enhance local employment, others have raised concerns about potential challenges in finding adequately skilled local candidates and the implications of the mandatory Kannada proficiency requirement.

### Next Steps

The bill will be formally presented in the Karnataka assembly on July 18. If passed, it will mark a landmark shift in the state's employment policies, reinforcing the government's commitment to prioritizing local talent and addressing regional disparities in job opportunities.

As the legislative process unfolds, all eyes will be on the assembly's deliberations and the potential impact of this bill on Karnataka's industrial landscape.
