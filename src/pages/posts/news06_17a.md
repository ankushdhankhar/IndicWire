**Assam Chief Minister Announces End to Free Electricity for Public Servants**

In a significant policy shift aimed at curbing expenses and promoting fiscal responsibility, Assam Chief Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma declared that all public servants in the state will be required to pay for their electricity consumption starting July 1, 2024. This announcement, made by Sarma in a video message on Sunday, marks the conclusion of the longstanding practice where government officials' electricity bills were covered by taxpayer funds.

Furthermore, Sarma emphasized his commitment to lead by example in this initiative. He announced that both himself and the Chief Secretary of Assam will commence paying their electricity bills from July 1, setting a precedent for others in the government to follow suit.

"We are ending the VIP culture rule of paying electricity bills for government officials using taxpayer money. Myself and the Chief Secretary will set an example and start paying our power bills from July 1 onwards," stated Chief Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma.

The decision is part of a broader effort by the Assam government to rationalize expenses and ensure that public resources are utilized efficiently. By mandating that public servants bear the cost of their electricity consumption, the government aims to foster greater accountability and transparency in financial matters.

This policy change is expected to affect thousands of public servants across various departments and offices in Assam. It comes amidst ongoing efforts by the state government to streamline governance and enhance public service delivery.

The announcement by Chief Minister Sarma has garnered mixed reactions, with some applauding the move as a step towards reducing unnecessary expenditures, while others raise concerns about its impact on lower-income government employees.

As Assam prepares for the implementation of this new directive, attention is now focused on how effectively it will be enforced and its broader implications for governance practices in the state.
