**NIA Raids Conducted in Tamil Nadu Over Hizb-ut-Tahrir Conspiracy Probe**

*Chennai, September 24, 2024* â€” The National Investigation Agency (NIA) carried out a series of coordinated raids across multiple locations in Tamil Nadu on Monday, as part of an ongoing probe into a conspiracy involving the banned extremist organization, Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The raids, which were conducted simultaneously in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, and Tirunelveli, are part of a wider crackdown on suspected members and supporters of the group.

### Key Locations Targeted

According to officials, the operation involved searches at the homes and offices of individuals suspected of having links with Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The group, known for advocating the establishment of a global Islamic caliphate, has been banned in India for its extremist ideology and attempts to radicalize youth.

**Chennai:** Investigators reportedly seized electronic devices, documents, and other material that may provide leads about the organization's network in the state. 

**Coimbatore & Madurai:** These areas have been identified as potential hubs for recruitment and propaganda dissemination. The NIA focused on suspected sleeper cells and handlers responsible for radicalization efforts, particularly targeting vulnerable communities.

**Tirunelveli:** A raid in this region revealed financial records that could be tied to external funding sources suspected of aiding the group's activities.

### Arrests and Detainees

The NIA has detained several individuals for questioning, though it remains unclear how many arrests have been made as of now. Officials have not ruled out further detentions based on ongoing investigations.

### Background: Hizb-ut-Tahrir in India

The NIA launched the current probe after receiving intelligence that the group's operatives were plotting to establish sleeper cells and recruit members from southern states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. The group has been active in using social media to disseminate extremist propaganda and attract youth into its fold.

Security agencies have been on high alert, monitoring online platforms and conducting surveillance to prevent the spread of the group's ideology, especially after similar crackdowns in other parts of the country. This operation marks one of the largest NIA actions against Hizb-ut-Tahrir in recent times.

### Political and Security Reactions

The raids have garnered attention from local political leaders. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin assured the public that the state government is fully cooperating with central agencies to ensure that extremist activities are curbed.

Security experts have praised the swift action, citing concerns about the potential radicalization of youth in the region, particularly through online channels.

### Next Steps

The seized material will now be thoroughly examined by forensic teams, and officials are expected to make more arrests in the coming days as the investigation unfolds. Sources say that the NIA is working closely with both domestic and international agencies to track potential links between local operatives and foreign extremist networks.

As Tamil Nadu remains under heightened security, the NIA's crackdown is seen as part of India's broader effort to dismantle extremist organizations and prevent radical elements from gaining a foothold in the country.
