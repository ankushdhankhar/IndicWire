**Hundreds of Kuki-Zo Tribals Demand Union Territory Status Amid Ethnic Conflict in Manipur**

In a significant development across Manipur's hill districts, hundreds of Kuki-Zo tribal people have mobilized in a united call for a Union Territory (UT) status and a lasting political resolution to the persistent ethnic strife in the region. The Kuki-Zo community, encompassing various sub-groups such as the Kukis and Zomis, has historically inhabited the remote hill areas of Manipur, enduring prolonged periods of conflict and instability.

The recent protests, which saw a large turnout of community members from different parts of the state, underscored deep-seated grievances and aspirations for political autonomy and security. At the forefront of their demands is the establishment of a Union Territory, which they believe will provide them with a more empowered governance structure and better safeguards for their cultural and territorial interests.

Speaking to media representatives during the demonstrations, Kuki-Zo leaders reiterated their commitment to seeking a "political solution" that addresses the longstanding grievances and ensures equitable representation and protection for their community. They highlighted the need for a comprehensive dialogue involving all stakeholders to achieve a sustainable peace and development in the region.

The call for a Union Territory status reflects a culmination of decades-long aspirations among the Kuki-Zo people for greater self-governance and administrative control over their ancestral lands. Amid sporadic outbreaks of violence and conflicts with other ethnic groups in Manipur, the Kuki-Zo community has faced challenges in asserting their cultural identity and socioeconomic development.

The mobilization of hundreds of tribal members into the streets of Manipur's hill districts signals a renewed urgency and determination to push forward their demands on the national agenda. It also serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and sensitivities surrounding ethnic relations and political autonomy in India's northeastern states.

As the situation evolves, stakeholders including government officials, local administrations, and civil society organizations are expected to engage in constructive dialogues to address the grievances and aspirations of the Kuki-Zo community. The outcome of these deliberations will likely shape the future socio-political landscape of Manipur, potentially paving the way for a more inclusive and harmonious coexistence among its diverse ethnic communities.
