### Historic Transition: India Implements New Criminal Laws

**New Delhi, July 1, 2024** — In a landmark move, three new criminal laws—Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)—came into effect nationwide on Monday, replacing the colonial-era Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and Indian Evidence Act (IEA), respectively. These reforms mark a significant departure from the laws that have governed India's criminal justice system since the British colonial period.

#### **First FIR Under New Laws**

The first First Information Report (FIR) under the new legal framework was registered at Delhi's Kamla Market Police Station. The FIR was filed against a street vendor, signaling the commencement of the practical application of these comprehensive legislative changes.

#### **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita replaces the Indian Penal Code, which was enacted in 1860. The BNS aims to modernize the substantive criminal law to better align with contemporary societal values and norms. It addresses various offenses and prescribes punishments while focusing on a more victim-centric approach.

#### **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)**

The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita succeeds the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The BNSS reforms procedural aspects of criminal law, ensuring faster and more efficient justice delivery. Key changes include streamlined processes for filing FIRs, conducting investigations, and carrying out trials, with an emphasis on protecting the rights of both the accused and the victims.

#### **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)**

The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam takes over from the Indian Evidence Act of 1872. The BSA modernizes the rules of evidence, making them more relevant to current technological advancements and societal changes. It aims to enhance the reliability and admissibility of evidence in court proceedings.

#### **Rationale Behind the Reforms**

The introduction of these new laws is part of the Indian government's broader efforts to decolonize the legal system and make it more responsive to the needs of a modern, independent India. The colonial-era laws, despite numerous amendments over the years, were often seen as outdated and not fully reflective of Indian values and realities.

The Home Minister, in a recent address, stated, "These new laws represent a significant step forward in our journey towards a more just and equitable society. They are designed to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done, with a focus on protecting the rights and dignity of all citizens."

#### **Implications and Future Outlook**

Legal experts and practitioners have largely welcomed the new laws, though they acknowledge the need for thorough training and familiarization with the new provisions. Police forces, judiciary members, and legal professionals across the country are undergoing extensive training to ensure a smooth transition.

The public response has been mixed, with some expressing optimism about the potential for more efficient justice delivery and others voicing concerns about the implementation challenges.

As these laws take root, their impact on India's criminal justice system will be closely monitored. The shift represents not just a legal reform but a cultural and systemic transformation aimed at enhancing the fairness and efficacy of the justice delivery mechanism in India.
