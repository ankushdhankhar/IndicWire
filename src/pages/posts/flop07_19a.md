### Bengaluru Mall Denies Entry to Dhoti-Clad Farmer; FIR Filed Against Owner, Security Guard

**Bengaluru, July 19, 2024** – In a controversial incident that has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, a farmer wearing a traditional dhoti was denied entry to a prominent mall in Bengaluru. The incident occurred on Thursday evening when the farmer, identified as Ramesh Gowda, attempted to enter the upscale Orion Mall in the city’s Rajajinagar area.

**Incident Details:**
Ramesh Gowda, a resident of a nearby village, had come to the city to buy some agricultural tools and decided to visit the mall. Upon arrival, he was stopped at the entrance by the security personnel, who allegedly cited the mall's dress code policy as the reason for denying him entry. Gowda, dressed in a clean and neatly draped dhoti, was reportedly humiliated and asked to leave the premises.

**Public Reaction:**
The incident quickly went viral after a bystander recorded a video of the altercation and posted it on social media. The video shows Gowda pleading with the security guards, explaining that dhoti is a traditional and respectable attire. The video has since garnered millions of views and triggered a wave of criticism against the mall's management.

Local farmer associations and social activists have condemned the incident, calling it an affront to the dignity of farmers and traditional Indian attire. Protests were organized outside the mall, with demonstrators demanding an apology and action against those responsible.

**Legal Action:**
Following the public outcry, an FIR was filed against the mall owner and the security guard involved in the incident. The police have booked them under sections of the Indian Penal Code that deal with wrongful restraint and insult to provoke breach of peace.

**Official Statements:**
In response to the backlash, Orion Mall issued a statement expressing regret over the incident. "We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and distress caused to Mr. Ramesh Gowda. We respect all individuals and their traditional attire. An internal investigation is being conducted, and appropriate action will be taken against those responsible."

However, the apology has done little to assuage the anger of the public and various organizations. Prominent political leaders have also weighed in on the matter. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah tweeted, "This incident is a stark reminder that discrimination in any form is unacceptable. Farmers are the backbone of our society, and their traditional attire should be respected."

**Broader Implications:**
This incident has reignited discussions about cultural sensitivity and respect for traditional attire in modern India. It has highlighted the challenges faced by individuals from rural backgrounds in urban settings and the need for greater awareness and inclusivity.

As the investigation continues, the focus remains on ensuring justice for Ramesh Gowda and preventing such incidents in the future. The farmer has received widespread support from various quarters, with many pledging to stand by him in his fight for dignity and respect.
