5. **Security and Stability**: The BJP promises a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism, emphasizing the complete eradication of terrorism in the region. Amit Shah announced that the party would bring a white paper to fix the responsibility of those involved in the emergence of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

### Amit Shah's Address

Speaking at the manifesto release, Union Home Minister Amit Shah highlighted the BJP's long-standing commitment to Jammu & Kashmir. “Since Independence, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir has remained important for our party, and we've always tried to keep this region with India,” Shah said. He referred to the sacrifices of Pandit Prem Nath Dogra and Syama Prasad Mookerjee, noting that their struggle was carried forward by Jana Sangh and later by the BJP.

Shah also addressed the issues of terrorism and separatism, which plagued the region until 2014. He criticized previous governments for their "politics of appeasement" and asserted that the period from 2014 to 2024 would be recorded in "golden words" in the history of India and Jammu & Kashmir. Shah made it clear that Article 370 "is history, it will never return, and we won't let it happen," emphasizing that the article previously "gave weapons and stones in the hands of the youth."

### Opposition's Response

The BJP's manifesto drew criticism from rival parties, including the National Conference and its ally Congress, with Amit Shah specifically targeting their stance on Article 370. He condemned the National Conference's manifesto and Congress's "mute support" for it, contrasting it with the BJP’s firm stance on national integrity.

### Conclusion

The BJP's 25-point manifesto presents a vision for a transformed Jammu & Kashmir, focusing on economic growth, social welfare, cultural preservation, and security. As the assembly elections approach, the party is positioning itself as the force that can bring lasting peace and prosperity to the Union Territory.

The manifesto, coupled with the BJP's strong leadership and historical commitment to Jammu & Kashmir, is expected to resonate with voters, making this election a critical moment for the region's future.
