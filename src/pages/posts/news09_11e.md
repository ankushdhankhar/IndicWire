**Microsoft Acquires 16.4-Acre Land Parcel in Pune’s Hinjewadi for ₹520 Crore**

*September 11, 2024*

**Pune, India** – In a significant development in India's growing tech landscape, Microsoft Corporation has acquired a 16.4-acre land parcel in Pune's Hinjewadi area, one of the city's most prominent IT hubs. The deal, valued at ₹520 crore, marks Microsoft's strategic expansion in India, further solidifying Pune's position as a critical node in the global IT network.

### **Strategic Location in Hinjewadi**

Hinjewadi, located in the western periphery of Pune, has emerged as a major IT hub over the past two decades. Home to the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park, the area houses some of the biggest names in the technology sector, including Infosys, Wipro, and Cognizant. Microsoft's acquisition in this prime location signals the company's intent to deepen its roots in India's technology ecosystem.

The land parcel is expected to be used for the development of a state-of-the-art technology campus. While specific plans for the site have not yet been disclosed, industry insiders suggest that it could serve as a significant R&D facility, given Microsoft's focus on cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies.

### **Boost to Pune’s IT Sector**

The acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on Pune’s economy, particularly in the IT and real estate sectors. The development of a new Microsoft campus could lead to job creation, both directly in terms of IT professionals and indirectly in sectors such as construction, services, and retail.

Local real estate experts have noted that such a large-scale investment by a tech giant like Microsoft could further enhance Hinjewadi's attractiveness as a prime destination for technology companies. The move could also potentially lead to an appreciation in property values in and around the area, given the expected increase in demand for both residential and commercial spaces.

### **Microsoft’s Growth in India**

Microsoft's latest acquisition aligns with its broader strategy of expanding its presence in India, one of the fastest-growing digital markets in the world. India is home to one of Microsoft’s largest employee bases outside the United States, with offices in major cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai. The company has been heavily investing in data centers and cloud infrastructure in the country, driven by the rising demand for digital services.

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, has repeatedly emphasized the importance of India in the company’s global strategy. This acquisition in Pune further cements Microsoft’s commitment to fostering innovation and leveraging India’s vast talent pool.

### **Government Support and Infrastructure**

The Maharashtra government has been proactive in supporting IT investments in the state, providing incentives and developing infrastructure to attract global companies. The acquisition by Microsoft is expected to receive full backing from state authorities, who have been keen to position Pune as a leading technology destination.

The existing infrastructure in Hinjewadi, coupled with ongoing developments like the upcoming Pune Metro line, which will connect Hinjewadi to other parts of the city, makes the location even more attractive for large-scale investments.

### **Conclusion**

Microsoft's acquisition of the 16.4-acre land parcel in Pune’s Hinjewadi for ₹520 crore is a landmark deal that underscores the region’s significance in the global IT sector. As Microsoft continues to expand its footprint in India, this development is expected to bring significant economic benefits to Pune, further solidifying its status as a major technology hub in the country.
