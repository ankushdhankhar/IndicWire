**Tragic Failed Jailbreak in DR Congo Leaves Over 100 Dead**

In a devastating turn of events, a failed prison escape attempt in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in the deaths of more than 100 individuals, authorities confirmed late Wednesday.

The incident occurred at the Makala Central Prison in Kinshasa, the nation's capital, where an estimated 200 inmates attempted a mass breakout during the early hours of the morning. Security forces swiftly responded to the chaos that ensued, leading to a violent confrontation between prisoners and law enforcement.

According to the Ministry of Justice, the failed jailbreak involved the use of improvised weapons and barricades, leading to intense clashes that left numerous inmates and several guards dead. Preliminary reports indicate that over 150 prisoners were either killed or injured in the ensuing violence.

"Today is a dark day for our nation," stated Justice Minister Am√©lie Mbala in a brief press conference. "We are mourning the loss of many lives and are committed to thoroughly investigating how such a large-scale attempt could occur. Our priority is to bring those responsible to justice and prevent any future incidents."

Witnesses reported that the inmates had coordinated their escape attempt over several weeks, exploiting weaknesses in the prison's security infrastructure. International observers have raised concerns about the state of the prison system in DR Congo, highlighting issues such as overcrowding, inadequate facilities, and limited access to rehabilitation programs.

Human rights organizations have condemned the violence, calling for an independent investigation into the incident. Amnesty International stated, "This tragic event underscores the urgent need for comprehensive prison reform in the DR Congo. The loss of so many lives is unacceptable and highlights systemic failures that must be addressed immediately."

The government has pledged to review and strengthen prison security measures across the country. Additionally, there are calls for increased support and resources to improve the conditions within correctional facilities, aiming to prevent such tragedies in the future.

As the nation grapples with the aftermath of this catastrophe, families of the victims are seeking answers and justice. The full extent of the casualties is still being assessed, and authorities are working tirelessly to account for all individuals involved in the attempted jailbreak.
