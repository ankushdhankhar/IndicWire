**Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath Meets Uddhav Thackeray, Condemns Political 'Betrayal'**

*Mumbai, July 16, 2024* - In a significant display of support amidst ongoing political turmoil, Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, the Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath, visited Shiv Sena (UBT) Chief Uddhav Thackeray at his residence, 'Matoshree,' in Mumbai today. The meeting, which took place at the invitation of Thackeray, was a poignant moment, with the Shankaracharya addressing the media and expressing his profound concern over what he termed as the political 'betrayal' faced by the former Chief Minister of Maharashtra.

Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, a respected religious leader and spiritual guide, voiced his strong disapproval of the events that led to Thackeray's ousting. "We follow the Hindu religion, which values Punya (virtue) and Paap (sin). Vishwasghat (betrayal) is considered one of the greatest sins, and this is what happened to Uddhav Thackeray," he stated emphatically.

The Shankaracharya's words highlighted a deep-seated sense of injustice felt by Thackeray's supporters and sympathizers. He further articulated the ongoing pain and dissatisfaction within the community and the Shiv Sena (UBT) faction, which continues to reel from the fallout of the political upheaval. "Our pain over the betrayal will persist until Thackeray is reinstated as Chief Minister," he added, underscoring the spiritual and moral dimensions of the political crisis.

The meeting between Thackeray and the Shankaracharya comes at a time when the former Chief Minister is seeking to consolidate support and rally his followers. Thackeray, who served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra until June 2022, was ousted following a series of defections and political maneuvers that culminated in a new government being formed under the leadership of Eknath Shinde.

Thackeray's political career has been marked by significant achievements and challenges, with his tenure as Chief Minister being particularly notable for navigating the state through the COVID-19 pandemic. However, his leadership was abruptly cut short by what many in his camp describe as an act of betrayal by his own party members who sided with the opposition.

The Shankaracharya's visit is seen as a moral boost for Thackeray, reinforcing his standing among his followers and providing a spiritual endorsement in the face of adversity. The support from such a prominent religious figure adds a new dimension to Thackeray's ongoing political battle, emphasizing the ethical and religious implications of the political dynamics in Maharashtra.

As the political landscape in Maharashtra continues to evolve, the support of influential leaders like Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati could play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing the course of future events. The call for Thackeray's reinstatement as Chief Minister resonates with a significant section of the population, reflecting a broader sentiment of discontent and a yearning for justice.

The media address by the Shankaracharya, covered by news agency PTI, has sparked widespread discussion and debate, bringing the issue of political betrayal and its moral ramifications to the forefront of public discourse. As the situation unfolds, all eyes will be on Uddhav Thackeray and his next moves in his quest to reclaim his position and restore what his supporters believe to be the rightful order.
