### Rahul Gandhi Visits Flood-Hit Assam: Highlights Perennial Flood Issue

**Guwahati, July 9, 2024** – In his first visit to Assam since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi visited the flood-ravaged state on Monday, bringing attention to the severe impact of this year's monsoon floods. The disaster has claimed at least 78 lives and affected nearly 23 lakh people across 28 districts, according to the Press Trust of India.

#### Relief Camp Visit and Interactions

Gandhi’s itinerary included a visit to a relief camp in Fulertal, Cachar district, which is predominantly populated by the Hmar community. The camp visit provided him with firsthand insights into the challenges faced by the flood victims. He interacted with affected families, listening to their grievances and assessing the immediate needs for relief and rehabilitation.

#### Meeting with Assam Pradesh Congress Committee

Earlier in the day, members of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC), led by state Congress president Bhupen Borah, met with Gandhi. They submitted a memorandum urging him to raise the issue of Assam’s “perennial floods” in the parliament. The memorandum highlighted the chronic nature of the flooding problem in the state and the need for both immediate and long-term solutions.

#### Criticism of BJP Government

In a statement on X, Gandhi criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its handling of the flood situation. He accused the BJP-led “double-engine government” of gross mismanagement, stating that their promise of a “flood-free Assam” remained unfulfilled. He emphasized the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to tackle the flood issue in Assam.

“These numbers reflect the gross and grave mismanagement by BJP’s double-engine government which came to power with the promise of a ‘flood-free Assam’,” Gandhi wrote. “Assam needs a comprehensive and compassionate vision – proper relief, rehabilitation, and compensation in the short term, and a pan-Northeast water management authority to do everything necessary to control floods in the long term.”

#### Call for Central Government Support

Gandhi also called on the Central government to extend all possible support to Assam promptly. He reaffirmed his commitment to the people of Assam, stating, “I stand with the people of Assam, I am their soldier in Parliament, and I urge the Central govt to extend all possible help and support to the State expeditiously.”

#### Affected Areas and Response Efforts

The floods have severely impacted districts such as Cachar, Darrang, and Barpeta, among others. Thousands of people have been displaced, and there has been extensive damage to property and infrastructure. The state government, along with various non-governmental organizations, is actively involved in relief operations, but the scale of the disaster has overwhelmed the available resources.

#### Conclusion

Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Assam underscores the pressing need for both immediate relief and long-term solutions to the state's flooding problem. His call for a pan-Northeast water management authority highlights the need for a coordinated approach to water management in the region. As Assam continues to grapple with the aftermath of the floods, the spotlight remains on how both the state and central governments will address this perennial issue.
