### Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde Unveils Ladla Bhai Yojana: Major Push for Youth Empowerment

**Mumbai, July 17, 2024** – In a significant move aimed at boosting youth employment and skill development, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced the launch of the "Ladla Bhai Yojana" on the auspicious occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi. The new scheme promises financial support and valuable work experience to students and graduates across the state.

Under the Ladla Bhai Yojana, students who have passed their 12th grade will receive a monthly stipend of ₹6,000, diploma holders will get ₹8,000, and graduates will be entitled to ₹10,000 per month. In addition to the financial aid, the scheme offers a one-year apprenticeship in a factory, providing students with practical work experience to enhance their employability.

CM Shinde emphasized that the scheme is designed to create a skilled workforce, addressing the growing need for skilled professionals in various industries. "This is the first time in history that any government has introduced such a comprehensive scheme aimed at preparing a skilled workforce," Shinde stated. The announcement, reported by the Free Press Journal, underscores the government's commitment to empowering the youth and bridging the gap between education and employment.

### Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana: Empowering Women Across Maharashtra

The announcement of the Ladla Bhai Yojana comes just two weeks after the launch of another landmark initiative, the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. This scheme is targeted at women aged 21 to 60, offering a monthly allowance of ₹1,500 to eligible beneficiaries. The initiative aims to foster overall development and empowerment of women, focusing on economic independence, self-reliance, health, and nutrition.

Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar, during the state budget presentation, revealed that ₹46,000 crore will be allocated annually for the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. The scheme, set to be implemented in July, has already seen an overwhelming response, with 44 lakh online applications received within the first two weeks. The application deadline for underprivileged women is set for August 31.

### Government's Commitment to Social Welfare and Development

These initiatives reflect the Maharashtra government's proactive approach towards social welfare and development. The Ladla Bhai Yojana and Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana aim to address key issues of youth unemployment and women's empowerment, respectively. By providing financial support and opportunities for skill development, these schemes are expected to significantly impact the socio-economic landscape of the state.

CM Shinde's announcement on Ashadhi Ekadashi marks a pivotal moment in Maharashtra's journey towards creating an inclusive and empowered society. The government's focus on education, employment, and empowerment highlights its commitment to building a progressive and self-reliant Maharashtra.
