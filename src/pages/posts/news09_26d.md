**Rahul Gandhi Vows to Protest Inside, Outside Parliament for Jammu and Kashmir’s Statehood**

*Jammu, September 26, 2024*: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a powerful appeal for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood during an election rally in Jammu. He criticized the 2019 decision to revoke the region's special status and bifurcate it into two Union Territories as “a grave injustice” to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Gandhi vowed that his party would continue to protest both inside and outside the Parliament until full statehood is restored.

Addressing the crowd, Gandhi emphasized the historical and cultural significance of Jammu and Kashmir's identity as a state. He remarked, "Jammu and Kashmir was not just a piece of land, but a symbol of India's diversity and unity. The decision to strip its statehood was not only unconstitutional but also an insult to its people."

He pointed out the adverse consequences of the 2019 bifurcation, noting the economic downturn, rising unemployment, and feelings of disenfranchisement among the region's citizens. “The BJP government promised development and peace, but the reality is far from it. Instead, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have faced increased hardships.”

Gandhi also criticized the central government's handling of security in the region, stating that the militarization has only alienated the local population further. He called for "genuine democratic processes" to be restored, ensuring that the people's voices are heard and respected.

**Restoration of Statehood a Key Poll Issue**

Rahul Gandhi reiterated that the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood would be a central agenda of the Congress party in the upcoming elections. He urged the voters to reject the “divisive and authoritarian” policies of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), arguing that the future of the region depends on reclaiming its lost autonomy.

“We will raise this issue every single day in Parliament. We will not rest until Jammu and Kashmir are restored as a full state, with all the rights and privileges it deserves,” he declared.

**Political Reactions**

Gandhi’s statements drew sharp responses from political rivals. BJP leaders criticized his stance, accusing the Congress of "playing politics" over national security issues. However, regional parties such as the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) welcomed his comments, calling the restoration of statehood "long overdue."

**Public Sentiment**

In Jammu, Gandhi’s rally saw significant turnout, with many attendees expressing support for the restoration of statehood. Several citizens voiced their frustration with the current Union Territory status, stating that it had undermined their political representation and regional identity.

Rahul Gandhi's push for statehood is expected to be a major flashpoint in the upcoming elections, as the Congress positions itself as the voice of those disaffected by the BJP’s handling of Jammu and Kashmir.
