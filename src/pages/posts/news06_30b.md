**Muslim BJP Member Brutally Attacked in West Bengal**

**Kolkata, June 30, 2024** â€” In a shocking and brutal attack, Rosonara Khatun, a Muslim member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was subjected to severe violence in West Bengal. The incident has sparked outrage and condemnation from political leaders and human rights organizations across the country.

**Incident Details**

The attack occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning in a village near Kolkata. According to eyewitnesses, Khatun was intercepted by a group of unidentified assailants while she was returning home.

Local residents rushed to her aid and took her to a nearby hospital, where she is currently receiving treatment for her injuries. Her condition is reported to be stable but critical.

**Police Response**

The police have registered a case and initiated an investigation following Khatun's hospitalisation. A senior police official stated, "We are treating this case with the utmost priority. We have collected initial evidence and are working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators. Such acts of violence will not be tolerated."

The incident has triggered widespread condemnation. Leaders from various political parties have expressed their shock and anger over the attack. BJP spokesperson, Amit Malviya, said, "This barbaric attack on Rosonara Khatun is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence our members. We demand swift justice and stringent action against those responsible."

Human rights organizations have also voiced their concerns. Amnesty International India released a statement saying, "The brutal assault on Rosonara Khatun is a grave violation of human rights and an attack on the democratic fabric of our nation. Authorities must ensure a thorough investigation and bring the culprits to justice."
