**Macron Backs India's Permanent Seat on a Reformed UN Security Council at UNGA**

*New York, September 26, 2024* — French President Emmanuel Macron voiced strong support for India's inclusion as a permanent member of a reformed United Nations Security Council (UNSC) during his address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Wednesday. The French leader also endorsed the candidacies of Brazil, Germany, Japan, and two African nations for permanent membership, advocating for an overhaul to make the UN more reflective of today's global realities.

Speaking to global leaders at the UN headquarters in New York, Macron emphasized the need for a more efficient and representative Security Council. "Let's make the UN more efficient. We need to make it more representative, and that’s why France is in favor of the Security Council being expanded," he stated.

Macron's remarks are part of growing international calls for reforming the UNSC, an institution that has been criticized for not adequately representing emerging powers and the changing geopolitical landscape. The council’s current permanent members, which include the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France, were selected in the aftermath of World War II.

"Germany, Japan, India, and Brazil should be permanent members, along with two countries that Africa will decide to represent them," Macron added, signaling France’s clear stance on inclusivity for regions traditionally underrepresented in global decision-making forums.

Macron’s statement reinforces longstanding demands by India and other nations for greater participation in global governance. India has been lobbying for a permanent seat in the UNSC for years, citing its growing economic and geopolitical influence as the world’s most populous country and a major global democracy.

African nations are expected to deliberate among themselves to nominate two countries that will represent the continent, further widening the scope for inclusive governance at the international level.

As the push for UNSC reform gains traction, Macron's call is expected to further intensify the debate around restructuring the UN to address modern-day challenges, such as climate change, conflict resolution, and sustainable development.

The proposed expansion is anticipated to face resistance from some current permanent members, particularly China, which has previously opposed India’s candidacy. However, Macron’s strong advocacy adds significant weight to the global push for change, emphasizing the need for an equitable, efficient, and more representative UN system.
