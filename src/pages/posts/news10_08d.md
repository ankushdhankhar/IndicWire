**Rajnath Singh Flags Arming of Civilian Products, Calls for Deeper Understanding of Technologies at DefConnect 2024**

**New Delhi, October 8, 2024** – Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today emphasized the growing convergence between civilian and military technologies, urging stakeholders to develop an in-depth understanding of how civilian products can be effectively used in defense applications. Singh was speaking at the DefConnect 2024 event, where he inaugurated key initiatives aimed at bolstering India's defense research and innovation ecosystem.

During the event, Singh launched the second edition of *Accelerated Defence Technology Innovation Initiative* (ADITI 2.0) and the 12th edition of *Defence India Startup Challenge* (DISC-12). Both initiatives aim to harness innovative technologies from startups and private sector players, further integrating them into India's defense manufacturing sector.

### Key Highlights from DefConnect 2024

**Arming Civilian Technologies:**  
Singh underscored the increasing relevance of adapting civilian technologies for defense purposes. "The lines between civilian and military applications are blurring, and it is critical to gain a comprehensive understanding of how civilian products can be armed and repurposed for national security," he said. He stressed that the rise of dual-use technologies – innovations designed for both civilian and military use – requires new strategies for development and implementation.

**Private Sector Role in Defence Innovation:**  
The Defence Minister commended the growing role of private sector companies in defense research and manufacturing. He emphasized that initiatives like ADITI 2.0 and DISC-12 will help bridge the gap between the innovation-driven private sector and the defense sector's specific needs. The challenges under DISC-12 focus on finding solutions in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), drones, cybersecurity, and more.

### ADITI 2.0 and DISC-12 Challenges

ADITI 2.0 is a platform aimed at accelerating the integration of cutting-edge technologies into India’s defense sector. It builds on the success of its predecessor by expanding its focus to encompass a broader range of technological fields, such as autonomous systems, renewable energy solutions, and advanced sensors.

DISC-12 challenges, meanwhile, are designed to bring out innovative solutions from startups in critical areas. Singh noted that the DISC platform had already seen success with several startups contributing to key defense technologies.

### Strengthening India's Defence Ecosystem

The launch of these initiatives is part of a broader effort to reduce India's dependence on foreign defense technologies. Singh reiterated the government’s commitment to “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) in the defense sector. The push towards indigenization in defense production is seen as a strategic imperative in light of the evolving global security environment.

As India continues to face complex security challenges, the integration of civilian innovations into defense capabilities could provide a significant boost to the nation’s preparedness. The initiatives unveiled at DefConnect 2024 reflect India’s ambitions to become a global leader in defense technology by leveraging its growing technological expertise.

### Conclusion

Rajnath Singh’s remarks signal the importance of innovation and adaptability in the defense sector. The ADITI 2.0 and DISC-12 challenges mark yet another step in India's journey towards becoming a defense technology powerhouse, while also strengthening the role of startups and private players in shaping the future of India's defense capabilities.
