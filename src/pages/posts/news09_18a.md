**Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sons Summoned by ED in Land-for-Jobs Case**

*Patna, September 18, 2024* – In a significant development, a special court has summoned former railway minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and his sons, Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, in connection with the ongoing investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the land-for-jobs scam. 

The case revolves around allegations that during Lalu Yadav's tenure as railway minister from 2004 to 2009, individuals were provided jobs in exchange for land parcels transferred to his family at heavily undervalued rates.

### Judge Cites Prima Facie Evidence
The special judge noted that Lalu Yadav, in his position as railway minister, was prima facie capable of facilitating jobs, and there was sufficient evidence to suggest that various individuals had indeed transferred land to his family in exchange for railway jobs. This, the court said, justified the summoning of the former minister and his sons for further questioning.

According to the ED, the Yadav family acquired numerous properties in Patna and other locations through "benami" transactions, wherein individuals who received employment with the railways allegedly transferred their properties to companies controlled by Lalu Yadav's relatives or associates.

### Political Impact
Tejashwi Yadav, Bihar’s Deputy Chief Minister, and his elder brother, Tej Pratap, have been vocal in defending their family against these allegations, calling the charges politically motivated. The timing of the summons comes just ahead of crucial assembly sessions in Bihar, which could have far-reaching consequences for the state’s political landscape. 

### RJD's Stand
The RJD has maintained that the charges against Lalu Yadav and his family are an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to weaken their political stronghold in Bihar. Senior leaders from the party have publicly criticized the central government for allegedly using investigating agencies to target opposition leaders.

### ED's Case and Prior Investigations
The ED’s investigation is part of a larger probe into the alleged corruption during Lalu Yadav’s tenure as railway minister. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has also been investigating the case, and Lalu Yadav has previously been questioned multiple times regarding the alleged land-for-jobs scam.

As the legal proceedings continue, this case is likely to draw more attention in Bihar’s political circles, especially with its potential to influence upcoming elections. The Yadav family's political future remains under scrutiny as they face legal challenges amidst accusations of corruption and misuse of power.
