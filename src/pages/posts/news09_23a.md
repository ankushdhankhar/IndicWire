**India Reports First Case of Clade 1 Variant of Mpox; Patient's Condition Stable, Says Union Health Ministry**

*September 23, 2024, New Delhi:* India has reported its first case of the Clade 1 variant of Mpox (formerly known as Monkeypox), the Union Health Ministry confirmed today. The patient, whose identity has not been disclosed, is currently in stable condition and receiving treatment at a designated isolation facility.

According to the health officials, the case was detected in a northern state, and the patient is under close medical observation. “We are monitoring the situation closely, and all necessary precautions are being taken to prevent any spread of the virus,” a senior health ministry official stated.

**Details of the Case**
The Clade 1 variant of Mpox has garnered attention due to its potential for more severe symptoms compared to other variants of the virus. However, health officials have reassured the public that the infected patient is receiving the appropriate antiviral treatment and remains stable.

The ministry has initiated contact tracing, and individuals who were in close contact with the patient have been quarantined as a precautionary measure. So far, no secondary cases have been reported. 

**Union Health Ministry’s Response**
The Union Health Ministry has urged citizens to remain vigilant but calm. “There is no cause for alarm at this stage. We are fully equipped to handle the situation. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are actively working to contain the virus,” the ministry spokesperson said.

The ministry is coordinating with state health departments to ensure heightened surveillance, particularly in regions with higher international travel. The public has been advised to follow hygiene protocols, avoid close contact with infected individuals, and report any symptoms such as fever, rash, or swollen lymph nodes to medical authorities immediately.

**Global Context**
Mpox was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022. It is typically transmitted through close skin-to-skin contact or through exposure to respiratory droplets. While cases of Clade 1 have been rare globally, this variant is noted for its more pronounced clinical manifestations.

India had previously reported a small number of cases involving different variants of Mpox, but this is the first known case involving Clade 1.

**Conclusion**
The Union Health Ministry emphasized that the country's healthcare system is well-prepared to tackle the situation and that routine health services remain unaffected. A public advisory has been issued, encouraging people to practice good hygiene and avoid stigmatization of patients. 

Further updates are expected as more details emerge from the ongoing investigation into the case.
