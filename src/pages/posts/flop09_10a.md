### Allegations of Political Victimisation in Terror Funding Case: Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid's Imprisonment Since August 2019

**Background:**
Engineer Sheikh Abdul Rashid, commonly known as Engineer Rashid, a prominent political figure from North Kashmir and former MLA from the Langate constituency, has been in jail since August 2019. His detention is linked to a terror funding case that dates back to 2017, involving several prominent Kashmiris. Rashid, who has been a vocal critic of both the Indian government's policies in Jammu and Kashmir and the mainstream political establishment in the region, has alleged that his imprisonment is a result of his political stance.

**The Case Against Rashid:**
Rashid was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in August 2019, under charges related to terror funding. The NIA accused him of being involved in a larger conspiracy to finance terrorism in the Kashmir Valley. This case is part of a broader investigation that began in 2017, following the unrest in Kashmir after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in 2016. The NIA's probe targeted several separatist leaders, businessmen, and other influential figures in Kashmir, alleging that they were part of a network that funded terrorism in the region.

The specific allegations against Rashid include receiving funds from Pakistan and other sources to promote anti-India activities and incite violence in the Valley. The NIA claims that Rashid had links with banned terrorist organizations and that he used his political platform to further their agenda.

**Rashid’s Defence:**
Rashid has consistently denied all charges against him, stating that he is being targeted for his outspoken political views. He has maintained that his only "crime" is his advocacy for the rights and aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Rashid has been a vocal critic of the Indian government's approach to Kashmir, particularly its decision to revoke Article 370 and strip the region of its special status in August 2019.

Rashid has argued that his arrest is part of a larger crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, aimed at silencing voices that challenge the government's narrative. His lawyers have pointed out that the evidence against him is flimsy and based on coerced testimonies. They have also highlighted the prolonged detention without trial, which they argue is a violation of his basic rights.

**Political Implications:**
Rashid's arrest has sparked widespread concern and criticism, both within Jammu and Kashmir and beyond. Many see his detention as emblematic of the broader repression faced by political leaders and activists in the region. The use of anti-terror laws to detain political opponents has been criticized by human rights organizations, who argue that it stifles democratic dissent and undermines the rule of law.

Rashid’s incarceration has also had significant political ramifications in Kashmir. His political party, the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), has been largely inactive since his arrest. Rashid was known for his populist style and grassroots appeal, and his absence has left a void in the political landscape of North Kashmir. His supporters have expressed disillusionment with the political process, further deepening the alienation felt by many in the region.

**Current Status:**
As of September 2024, Engineer Rashid remains in custody, with no significant progress in his trial. His repeated bail applications have been denied, and his legal team continues to face obstacles in accessing case documents and witnesses. Rashid's health has reportedly deteriorated during his time in prison, raising concerns about his well-being.

In a recent statement, Rashid reiterated his commitment to his political beliefs, stating that he will continue to fight for the rights of Kashmiris, even from behind bars. His case remains a contentious issue in Kashmir, symbolizing the broader challenges of justice and human rights in the region.

**Conclusion:**
Engineer Rashid’s prolonged imprisonment has become a focal point in the ongoing discourse on political repression in Kashmir. His case underscores the complex and often contentious relationship between the Indian state and the region's political actors. As the legal proceedings continue to drag on, the broader implications for Kashmir’s political future remain uncertain, with Rashid’s fate hanging in the balance.
