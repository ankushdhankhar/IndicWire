**Canada's Opposition Leader Calls for Deportation of Immigrants Who Break the Law**

**Toronto, September 15, 2024** – In a bold political move, the Leader of Canada's Opposition, has called for stricter measures on immigration, specifically advocating for the immediate deportation of immigrants who break the law. The remarks came during a press conference on Monday, where the Opposition leader outlined his party’s stance on law and order and immigration policies.

"Our immigration system must uphold the safety and security of Canadian citizens. Immigrants who come to Canada are welcome, but those who break our laws should face consequences, including deportation," said the Opposition leader. He added that his party would prioritize law-abiding immigrants while ensuring that those who threaten public safety are removed from the country.

This statement is part of a broader policy package aimed at tightening immigration rules, with the Opposition proposing reforms to fast-track deportations for those involved in criminal activities. The leader also criticized the current government for what he called a "lenient" approach, suggesting that Canada’s judicial and immigration systems allow too many appeals and loopholes for convicted criminals to remain in the country.

The comments have sparked a significant debate across Canada, with human rights organizations and immigrant advocacy groups expressing concern. "This rhetoric undermines the contributions of immigrants to Canada’s social fabric," said a spokesperson from the Canadian Council for Refugees. "Criminal justice should not be used as a pretext for deporting people who may have rehabilitated or faced other hardships."

Supporters of the Opposition leader argue that deporting law-breaking immigrants is essential to maintaining public trust in the immigration system. "If you come to Canada, you must follow the laws. There can be no exceptions," said a party supporter at the event.

The ruling party has yet to officially respond to these comments, but sources within the government indicate that they will continue to focus on maintaining a balanced approach to immigration, one that upholds public safety while also respecting the rights of immigrants and their families.

As the country heads towards an election, immigration is set to be a defining issue, and the Opposition's call for deportation policies will likely be central to their platform.
