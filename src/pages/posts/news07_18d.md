**Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Pledges to Combat 'Demographic Change' as Muslim Population Reaches 40%**

**Date: July 18, 2024**

**Guwahati, Assam** â€” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has vowed to take decisive action against what he describes as a significant demographic shift in the state, citing that the Muslim population has reached 40%. Sarma, who has often been vocal about issues related to illegal immigration and demographic changes, reiterated his commitment to protecting the cultural and demographic integrity of Assam.

During a press conference held in Guwahati, CM Sarma expressed his concerns over the rapid increase in the Muslim population, attributing it largely to illegal immigration from neighboring Bangladesh. "Assam is facing a demographic invasion," Sarma stated. "We cannot sit idle while our cultural and demographic landscape is altered. We will take all necessary measures to preserve Assam's identity."

### Measures to Combat Demographic Change

Sarma outlined a series of measures his government plans to implement in response to this demographic shift. These include:

1. **Enhanced Border Security**: The Assam government will coordinate with central agencies to strengthen security along the India-Bangladesh border. This will involve increasing the presence of border patrols and implementing advanced surveillance technologies to prevent illegal crossings.

2. **Stringent Identification and Deportation Policies**: Sarma announced the formation of special task forces to identify and deport illegal immigrants. He emphasized that those found without proper documentation would face legal action and deportation.

3. **Population Control Initiatives**: The government plans to introduce policies aimed at controlling population growth, particularly in regions with high birth rates. This includes promoting family planning and educational programs about the benefits of smaller families.

4. **Protection of Indigenous Rights**: Sarma assured the indigenous communities that their rights and land would be protected. "We will ensure that the rights of the indigenous people of Assam are not compromised," he said.

### Political and Social Reactions

The announcement has sparked a mixed response from various quarters. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has largely supported Sarma's stance, aligning it with their broader national policies on illegal immigration and national security.

However, opposition parties and several civil rights groups have criticized the measures, arguing that they could lead to communal tensions and discrimination against legitimate citizens. "The government's approach is divisive and risks marginalizing a significant portion of our population," said Debabrata Saikia, leader of the opposition in the Assam Legislative Assembly. "We need inclusive policies that promote harmony and development for all communities."

### Community Concerns

Members of the Muslim community in Assam have expressed anxiety over the Chief Minister's statements. "We are worried about the potential for increased harassment and discrimination," said Abdul Rahim, a local community leader. "Our community contributes to the state's economy and culture, and we want to live in peace and security."

### National Implications

Sarma's comments and the proposed measures are likely to resonate beyond Assam, influencing the national discourse on immigration and demographic change. As India approaches the 2024 general elections, these issues are expected to be key topics of debate among political parties and voters alike.

**Conclusion**

As Assam navigates these complex demographic dynamics, the government's actions and policies will be closely watched. Balancing security concerns with the need for social harmony and inclusivity will be crucial for maintaining peace and stability in the state.
