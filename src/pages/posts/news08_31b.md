**Wrestler Vinesh Phogat Joins Farmers' Protest at Shambhu Border, Urges Government to Fulfill Promises** 

**Date:** August 31, 2024

**Location:** Shambhu Border, Haryana-Delhi

Wrestler Vinesh Phogat, a prominent figure in Indian sports, has joined the ongoing farmers' protest at the Shambhu border, which has now reached its 200th day. The protest, spearheaded by several farmer groups, is centered on the demand for a legal guarantee of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. 

The Shambhu border, which connects Haryana and Delhi, has become a significant site of dissent since February 13, 2024. Hundreds of farmers have been camping here, braving the elements and continuing their agitation despite numerous challenges. Their primary demand is for the Central government to fulfill the promises made to them during earlier negotiations, including the crucial issue of MSP.

Vinesh Phogat, speaking from the protest site, expressed deep concern over the prolonged struggle of the farmers. She emphasized the critical role that farmers play in the nation, stating, “It has been 200 days since they are sitting here. It is painful to see this. All of them are citizens of this country. Farmers run the country. Nothing is possible without them, not even athletes—if they don't feed us, we won't be able to compete.”

Her words highlighted the interdependence between different sections of society, particularly the link between agriculture and sports. Phogat, who has represented India on global platforms, acknowledged the helplessness felt by many athletes who are unable to support their families despite their international achievements. Her statement, “Many a time we are helpless and can't do anything. We represent the country at such big levels but we can't do anything for our family even when we see them sad,” reflects the emotional toll that the ongoing situation has taken on the nation's psyche.

Phogat also issued a direct appeal to the government, urging them to take immediate action to resolve the situation. She referenced past negotiations where the government had acknowledged its mistakes, stressing that it is now time to fulfill the promises made to the farmers. “I urge the government that they should listen. They had admitted their mistake last time; they should fulfill the promises that they made. The country won't progress if people sit on streets like this,” Phogat asserted.

The ongoing protest at the Shambhu border is part of a larger movement that has seen farmers across India mobilizing to demand their rights and protections. The protestors argue that without a legal guarantee for MSP, their livelihoods remain at risk, subject to market fluctuations and potential exploitation.

The involvement of high-profile athletes like Vinesh Phogat has added a new dimension to the protest, drawing increased media attention and public support. As the protest continues into its 200th day, the pressure on the Central government to address the farmers' demands is mounting.

The situation at the Shambhu border remains tense but peaceful, with farmers and supporters continuing their vigil, hoping for a resolution that will secure their future and ensure the sustainability of Indian agriculture.
