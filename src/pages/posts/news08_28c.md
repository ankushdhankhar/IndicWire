**Uttar Pradesh Government Unveils New Social Media Policy: Influencers Can Earn Up to ₹8 Lakh Per Month**

**Lucknow, August 28, 2024** — The Uttar Pradesh government has introduced a comprehensive social media policy aimed at regulating content on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and X. The policy, which offers lucrative opportunities for influencers, also imposes strict penalties for objectionable or anti-national content.

Under this new policy, influencers can earn up to ₹8 lakh per month by promoting the state government's schemes and initiatives through their social media platforms. The initiative, announced by the Principal Secretary of the Information Department, Sanjay Prasad, is designed to both boost the state’s image and provide employment opportunities to citizens.

**Categorization and Payment Structure**

The policy categorizes influencers into four tiers based on their number of subscribers and followers. Payment limits are set accordingly:

- **X (formerly Twitter):** Up to ₹5 lakh per month
- **Facebook:** Up to ₹4 lakh per month
- **Instagram:** Up to ₹3 lakh per month
- **YouTube:**
  - **Videos:** Up to ₹8 lakh per month
  - **Shorts:** Up to ₹7 lakh per month
  - **Podcasts:** Up to ₹6 lakh per month

These limits reflect the government's commitment to using digital platforms for widespread dissemination of information while compensating influencers for their role in reaching diverse audiences.

**Regulation and Penalties**

The policy, however, comes with a strict code of conduct. Posting objectionable or anti-national content is considered a serious offense under the new regulations. Penalties for violations have not been explicitly detailed in the announcement but are expected to be stringent.

**Official Statement**

"The government has decided to list agencies and firms to give advertisements for promoting content through digital media. This will help in creating and displaying content, such as tweets, videos, posts, and reels, about the schemes and achievements of the U.P. Government, thereby generating employment opportunities for the citizens of the state," read the press note issued by the Information Department.

This policy is seen as a significant move by the Uttar Pradesh government to harness the power of social media while ensuring that the content shared aligns with national and state interests. Influencers across the state are expected to play a pivotal role in this digital outreach program, which aims to enhance public awareness and support for government initiatives.
