**Punjab Shiv Sena Leader Sandeep Thapar Attacked by Nihangs, Condition Critical**

**Ludhiana, Punjab, July 6, 2024** â€“ In a shocking incident that has sent ripples through the political and social landscape of Punjab, Sandeep Thapar, a prominent leader of the Punjab Shiv Sena and a descendant of Indian freedom fighter and martyr Sukhdev, was brutally attacked by a group of Nihangs. The incident occurred outside Ludhiana Civil Hospital on Saturday morning.

Thapar, who was at the hospital for a routine check-up, was ambushed by the Nihangs, who wielded swords in the attack. Eyewitnesses reported that the group, identifiable by their traditional blue attire and elaborate turbans, confronted Thapar and, without any provocation, launched a vicious assault.

The attack has left Thapar in a critical condition. He sustained multiple deep lacerations and has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Ludhiana Civil Hospital. Medical authorities have stated that his condition is serious, and he is currently undergoing intensive treatment and observation.

**Eyewitness Accounts and Reactions**

One eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, described the scene as chaotic and terrifying. "It happened so fast. One moment, Sandeep Thapar was walking towards the hospital entrance, and the next, he was being attacked by a group of Nihangs. They were relentless. People were screaming and running for cover," the eyewitness recounted.

The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and the police are investigating the incident from all possible angles. Initial reports suggest that the attack could be politically motivated, given Thapar's prominence in the Punjab Shiv Sena and his outspoken views on various issues.

**Political Reactions**

Political leaders across the spectrum have condemned the attack. Shiv Sena leaders have called for swift justice and increased security for their members. "This is an attack not just on Sandeep Thapar, but on democracy and the right to free speech. We demand immediate action against the perpetrators," said a senior Shiv Sena leader in a press statement.

Punjab Chief Minister has also condemned the attack and assured that the culprits will be brought to justice. "Such acts of violence have no place in our society. We will ensure that those responsible are punished severely," he said.

**Historical Context**

Sandeep Thapar is a descendant of Sukhdev Thapar, a revered Indian freedom fighter who was a close associate of Bhagat Singh. Sukhdev, along with Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, was executed by the British colonial authorities in 1931 for his role in the Indian independence movement. This historical connection adds a significant dimension to the attack on Thapar, evoking memories of sacrifice and the ongoing struggle for justice.

**Current Situation**

As of now, the Ludhiana Civil Hospital is under tight security, with police deployed in large numbers to prevent any further incidents. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have urged the public to remain calm and not to spread rumors or inflammatory messages.

The attack on Sandeep Thapar has undoubtedly left a mark on the socio-political fabric of Punjab. As he fights for his life, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the need for tolerance and the rejection of violence in resolving differences.
