**Why is the Opposition Silent on Rosonara Khatun's Assault? Is Democracy Not in Danger Now?**

**Kolkata, June 30, 2024** â€” The brutal assault on Rosonara Khatun, a Muslim member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has not only shocked the nation but has also raised questions about the silence of opposition parties. The incident, which took place in a village near Kolkata, West Bengal, involved Khatun being stripped naked, thrashed, and dragged along the road for nearly a kilometre by unidentified assailants. This tragic event has sparked a political debate on the consistency of the opposition's stance on democracy and justice.

**Political Context**

The incident has put the spotlight on the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-ruled West Bengal, where the assault took place. Despite the gravity of the situation, major opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, have remained silent. This silence has been perceived by many as a double standard, especially given the opposition's usual vocal stance on issues of democracy and human rights in BJP-ruled states.

**Public and Political Reactions**

BJP leaders have been quick to point out the opposition's silence. Amit Malviya, BJP spokesperson, stated, "If this brutal assault had happened in a BJP-ruled state, the opposition would have been out on the streets, protesting and demanding justice. Why are they silent now? Is democracy only in danger when it suits their political narrative?"

Many political analysts and commentators have echoed this sentiment, questioning the opposition's commitment to justice and democratic principles. Political analyst, Dr. Arvind Gupta, remarked, "The selective outrage of the opposition undermines their credibility. Their silence in the face of such a heinous act in an opposition-ruled state raises serious questions about their integrity and consistency."

**Rahul Gandhi's Silence**

Rahul Gandhi, known for his vocal criticism of the BJP government, has not yet commented on the incident. This has led to widespread criticism and speculation about his motivations. BJP leaders and supporters have questioned his commitment to democratic values and human rights, suggesting that his silence is politically motivated.

Social media has been abuzz with criticism, with hashtags such as #WhereIsRahulGandhi and #SelectiveOutrage trending. Many users have pointed out the irony in Gandhi's silence, given his frequent assertions that democracy is in danger under the Modi government.

**Opposition's Usual Stance**

Historically, the opposition has been vocal about incidents of violence and human rights abuses in BJP-ruled states. Protests, statements, and media appearances have been common tactics to highlight such issues. The current silence is a stark contrast to this usual approach, leading to accusations of hypocrisy and selective outrage.

**Implications for Democracy**

The silence of the opposition on Rosonara Khatun's assault raises broader questions about the state of democracy in India. It underscores the need for a consistent and principled approach to human rights and justice, irrespective of political affiliations. Senior journalist, Rajdeep Sardesai, commented, "Democracy is not about selective outrage. It is about standing up for justice and human rights at all times, irrespective of who is in power."

**Conclusion**

The brutal assault on Rosonara Khatun and the subsequent silence of the opposition highlight the complexities and contradictions in India's political landscape. As the investigation continues, the focus must remain on ensuring justice for Khatun and addressing the broader implications for democracy and human rights. The nation demands accountability and a reaffirmation of democratic principles from all political leaders, not just when it is politically convenient, but at all times.
