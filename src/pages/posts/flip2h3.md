# Modi on Manipur

**Prime Minister Narendra Modi** recently addressed the issue of violence in **Manipur**, a state in northeastern India. For over **70 days**, people from Manipur and beyond had been urging him to break his silence on the **ethnic conflict** in the region. The situation has resulted in approximately **150 lives lost** and tens of thousands of people displaced from their livelihoods.

In his remarks, **Modi** specifically referred to a **disturbing video** that had gone viral on social media. The video depicted two **Kuki women** being **paraded naked** in **Kangpokpi** on **May 4**. The **FIR** (First Information Report) on the incident indicated that one of the women was **gang-raped**. The prime minister expressed his **distress and anger** upon learning about this incident and emphasized that **all states** must take action to protect "our mothers and sisters." Notably, he did not single out Manipur, where his party is in power, but also mentioned **Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan** as states where governments should address violence against women. However, he did not mention other BJP-ruled states that have also witnessed violent incidents against women and girls.

Despite the gravity of the situation, **Modi's speech** focused primarily on this specific incident, seemingly overlooking the broader context of ongoing violence in Manipur. Here are some additional aspects that the prime minister could consider addressing in future remarks:

1. **The Wider Violence**: Since **May 3**, there has been a continuous stream of violence in Manipur. Tensions escalated after the **Meitei community** was granted **ST (Scheduled Tribe) status** by the Manipur High Court. Hill tribes in Manipur perceived this as a threat to their rights and carried out protests. The state has witnessed targeted violence, weapon looting, actions by vigilante groups (including women), and deaths and injuries. However, Modi's speech did not acknowledge this larger-scale violence, nor did it appeal for peace – a demand made by all parties involved ¹.

2. **Immediate Action**: Given the **79-day delay** in Modi's response, there was an expectation that he would address the immense devastation. Instead, he chose a more **confusing approach**, focusing solely on the viral video incident without providing a comprehensive overview of the situation.

In conclusion, while Modi's acknowledgment of the Kangpokpi incident is a step forward, there remains a need for a more comprehensive and proactive approach to address the ongoing crisis in Manipur.

During the recent **Manipur ethnic violence**, the central government took several **prompt actions** to address the crisis:

1. Engaging with Manipur authorities: Since **May 3**, the central government engaged with Manipur officials and deployed available **CAPF (Central Armed Police Forces)** companies to manage the situation¹.
2. Additional security forces: **124 companies of CAPF** and **184 columns of the Indian Army/Assam Rifles** were deployed to enhance security and maintain peace¹.
3. Aerial surveillance: **Helicopters and drones** were immediately deployed to monitor the affected areas¹.
4. Security advisor appointment: **Kuldiep Singh, IPS (retd.)** was appointed as a security advisor by the Manipur government and assumed charge on **May 4, 2023**¹.
5. Administrative reinforcement: **Vineet Joshi, IAS**, was recalled from the government of India and appointed as the chief secretary of Manipur on **May 7**¹.
6. Essential supplies: Adequate supply of **essential commodities** was ensured to support affected communities¹.
7. High-level visits: **Home Minister Amit Shah** visited Manipur between **May 29 and June 1**, holding more than **15 meetings** with government officials, security forces, political leaders, and civil society organizations. He also visited violence-hit areas and relief camps, interacting with affected communities¹.
8. Judicial inquiry: A **judicial inquiry** was initiated by a commission headed by a retired high court judge¹.
9. Investigation: **Six cases** were assigned for investigation by a **Special CBI team**¹.
10. Relief and rehabilitation: An immediate financial package of **₹101.75 crore** was provided for the relief and rehabilitation of people living in shelter camps¹.

Despite these efforts, the crisis remains complex, and addressing the broader context of violence in Manipur requires sustained attention and comprehensive strategies¹².
