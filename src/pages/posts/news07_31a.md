### Amit Shah Criticizes Kerala Government for Inaction on Early Warning of Wayanad Disaster

**New Delhi, July 31, 2024** â€” Union Home Minister Amit Shah, during a session in the Rajya Sabha, criticized the Kerala government for its lack of response to early warnings about a potential natural disaster in Wayanad. Shah stated that the central government had issued a warning on July 23 regarding heavy rains that could trigger a disaster in the region.

In his address, Shah mentioned that the central government acted swiftly by deploying nine National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to Kerala on the same day the warning was issued. "We had informed the Kerala government well in advance about the possibility of a natural disaster due to heavy rains in Wayanad. Despite our timely warning and the dispatch of NDRF teams, the state government did not take any necessary precautions or measures," Shah said.

The Union Home Minister's remarks came in the wake of widespread criticism of the handling of the situation in Wayanad, where incessant rains have caused significant damage to property and infrastructure, leaving many residents stranded and in dire need of assistance. Shah's comments highlighted the perceived negligence on the part of the Kerala state administration.

The NDRF teams, according to Shah, were prepared and ready to assist in evacuation and relief operations. However, their efforts were reportedly hindered by the state government's unresponsiveness. "The NDRF teams were on the ground and ready to act, but the lack of coordination and support from the state government hampered their effectiveness," Shah added.

In response to Shah's statements, the Kerala government has yet to issue a detailed response. However, state officials have previously argued that the sudden and unprecedented nature of the rains made it challenging to mobilize resources and respond effectively.

The situation in Wayanad remains critical, with rescue and relief operations ongoing. The central government's criticism of the Kerala administration underscores the need for better disaster preparedness and coordination between state and central agencies to mitigate the impact of natural calamities.

As the monsoon season continues, the focus remains on providing timely assistance to affected areas and ensuring that warnings and resources are effectively utilized to prevent future disasters.
