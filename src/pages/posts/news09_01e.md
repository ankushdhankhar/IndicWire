### **Gujarat Rains: 24 Crocodiles Rescued from Vadodara’s Residential Areas Amid Heavy Downpour**

**Vadodara, Gujarat — 01 sep, 2024**

In a remarkable operation, 24 crocodiles were successfully rescued from various residential areas in Vadodara between August 27 and August 29, 2024, following the heavy monsoon rains that lashed the region. The operation was carried out by the Forest Department and local wildlife rescuers, who responded to distress calls from residents across the city. Fortunately, no incidents of crocodile-human conflict were recorded during these rescue operations, ensuring the safety of both the reptiles and the local population.

### Heavy Rains Lead to Flooding and Crocodile Displacement

Vadodara, like much of Gujarat, experienced intense rainfall over the last week, leading to widespread flooding in both urban and rural areas. The city's proximity to the Vishwamitri River, which is home to a significant population of crocodiles, made the situation particularly challenging. The rising water levels forced many crocodiles out of their natural habitats and into residential areas, causing alarm among residents.

The Vishwamitri River, which flows through the heart of Vadodara, is known for its dense crocodile population. During the monsoon season, when the river swells, it is not uncommon for these reptiles to venture into nearby areas in search of shelter. This year, however, the number of crocodile sightings in residential areas surged, necessitating immediate intervention.

### Rescue Operations

Over the three-day period, a total of 24 crocodiles were safely captured from various locations across the city, including densely populated neighborhoods, parks, and even a few commercial areas. The Forest Department deployed specialized teams equipped with necessary tools and expertise to handle the situation. Each rescue was carefully executed to minimize stress on the animals and prevent any potential danger to the public.

"The safety of both the animals and the residents was our top priority. Our teams worked tirelessly around the clock to ensure that every crocodile was safely relocated to a suitable habitat," said a senior official from the Forest Department. The crocodiles were transported to secure locations, including the Vadodara zoo and designated wildlife sanctuaries, where they will be monitored until they can be released back into the wild.

### Community Response and Safety Measures

The presence of crocodiles in residential areas naturally caused anxiety among the residents, but the swift and coordinated response by the authorities helped to alleviate fears. The local administration also launched a public awareness campaign to educate citizens on how to respond if they encounter a crocodile, emphasizing the importance of staying calm and immediately contacting the authorities.

Residents were advised to avoid floodwaters and areas near the river, as well as to secure pets and livestock to prevent any unwanted encounters with the displaced reptiles. The city's efforts to manage the situation effectively were widely praised, with many residents expressing their gratitude for the prompt action taken by the rescue teams.

### A Call for Long-Term Solutions

The incident has once again highlighted the need for long-term solutions to mitigate the impact of heavy rains and flooding in crocodile-prone areas like Vadodara. Environmentalists and wildlife experts have called for enhanced measures to protect both the human population and the wildlife, including better flood management, improved habitat protection for crocodiles, and ongoing public education initiatives.

As Vadodara and the rest of Gujarat continue to recover from the heavy rains, the successful rescue of these 24 crocodiles stands as a testament to the dedication and efficiency of the region's wildlife conservation efforts. While the immediate threat has been managed, the focus now shifts to ensuring that both the local communities and the crocodiles can coexist safely in the future.
