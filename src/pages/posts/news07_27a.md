### Mosques and Mazar Facades Covered Along Kanwar Yatra Route in Haridwar, Uttarakhand

**Haridwar, Uttarakhand, July 27, 2024** - In a bid to “prevent trouble” during the ongoing Kanwar Yatra, the facades of two mosques and a mazar (shrine) along the yatra route in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, were covered with large sheets of white cloth. This move has sparked controversy and objections from various quarters, leading to the eventual removal of the sheets by the evening.

#### Background

The Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage dedicated to Lord Shiva, where devotees, known as Kanwariyas, collect holy water from the Ganges River and carry it across hundreds of kilometers to offer it at Shiva temples in their hometowns. Haridwar, a major pilgrimage city in Uttarakhand, sees an influx of millions of devotees during this period.

#### Covering of Religious Sites

Reports emerged early on July 27 that the facades of two mosques and a mazar located along the Kanwar Yatra route had been covered with white sheets. This action was reportedly taken by local authorities as a precautionary measure to “prevent trouble” and ensure a smooth passage for the Kanwariyas. The exact reasons for this preventive measure were not clearly communicated, leading to confusion and unrest among the local Muslim community.

#### Reactions and Objections

The decision to cover the religious sites drew immediate criticism from various quarters. Local residents, religious leaders, and social activists expressed their displeasure over the move, labeling it as an unnecessary and divisive action. 

Maulana Ahmed, a prominent religious leader in Haridwar, stated, “Covering the facades of our mosques and mazar sends a wrong message. It creates an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. We have always coexisted peacefully during the Kanwar Yatra, and such actions are uncalled for.”

Several social activists and political figures also weighed in on the issue. A local activist, Priya Sharma, commented, “This is a sensitive issue, and such actions can lead to communal tension. The authorities should have consulted the community before taking such a step.”

#### Removal of the Sheets

Following the widespread objections and media attention, the local administration decided to remove the white sheets by the evening of July 27. Officials stated that the decision to cover the facades was made with good intentions but acknowledged the oversight in not communicating with the local community beforehand.

District Magistrate R. Meena said, “Our intention was to ensure peace and harmony during the Kanwar Yatra. However, we understand the concerns raised by the community and have removed the coverings. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.”

#### Moving Forward

In light of this incident, the local administration has pledged to engage in more proactive and transparent communication with all communities to avoid similar controversies in the future. They have assured that security measures will be taken to ensure the safety and harmony of all residents and pilgrims during the Kanwar Yatra.

The removal of the sheets has been met with relief by the local Muslim community, and efforts are underway to restore trust and unity among the residents of Haridwar. As the Kanwar Yatra continues, authorities are keen on maintaining peace and ensuring that the religious sentiments of all communities are respected.

#### Conclusion

This incident highlights the delicate balance required in managing large-scale religious events in a diverse and multicultural society. Effective communication and mutual respect are crucial in ensuring that such events are conducted smoothly without causing unnecessary strife or tension.
