*Date: July 29, 2024*

In a recent statement, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman addressed the ongoing misinformation regarding budget allocations, emphasizing that Karnataka has received a substantial amount of Rs 2.96 lakh crores under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Speaking at a press conference, Sitharaman lashed out at the spread of false information concerning budget allocations to Karnataka, asserting that the figures being circulated are misleading and do not reflect the actual support extended to the state by the central government.

"The Modi government has consistently prioritized the development and welfare of Karnataka. The Rs 2.96 lakh crores allocated is a testament to our commitment to ensuring the state's growth and prosperity," said Sitharaman. She highlighted various developmental projects and schemes funded by the central government, which have significantly contributed to the state's infrastructure, healthcare, and education sectors.

The Finance Minister also addressed criticisms from opposition parties, which have accused the central government of neglecting Karnataka in the budget. "Such allegations are baseless and politically motivated. The facts speak for themselves. The central government has not only met but exceeded its commitments to Karnataka," she stated.

Sitharaman provided a detailed breakdown of the funds allocated, which include substantial investments in road construction, rural development, and urban infrastructure projects. She also mentioned the support given to the state during the COVID-19 pandemic, including financial aid and resources to bolster healthcare infrastructure.

In her address, Sitharaman urged the public to verify information from credible sources and not be swayed by misleading narratives. "Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of our administration. We urge citizens to rely on official channels for accurate information," she added.

The Finance Minister's remarks come at a crucial time as Karnataka gears up for upcoming state elections, with budget allocations and development projects being key issues of debate. Her assertion aims to reassure the public of the central government's unwavering support and commitment to the state's development.
