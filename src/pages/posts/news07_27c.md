### Himachal Pradesh High Court Urges State Government to Mandate Garbage Bags for Tourists

**Shimla, July 27, 2024** â€“ In a bid to tackle the mounting issue of waste generated by tourists, the Himachal Pradesh High Court has suggested that the state government make it mandatory for all tourists to carry a garbage bag during their visit. The directive was issued by a bench comprising Justices Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Sushil Kukreja, who emphasized the need for sustainable tourism practices to preserve the state's natural beauty.

The court's suggestion draws inspiration from successful waste management strategies implemented in other states, notably Goa and Sikkim. Both states have introduced measures to ensure tourists contribute to maintaining cleanliness in tourist hotspots. Goa mandates that tourists carry reusable bags for their trash, while Sikkim has implemented a comprehensive ban on single-use plastics and encourages the use of biodegradable alternatives.

**Court's Directive:**

The bench highlighted the increasing waste problem in popular tourist destinations across Himachal Pradesh, including Manali, Shimla, and Dharamshala. The accumulation of non-biodegradable waste not only mars the scenic beauty of these places but also poses a significant threat to the local ecosystem. 

Justice Chauhan remarked, "Tourists must take responsibility for the waste they generate. Providing them with a mandatory garbage bag will ensure that they are conscious of their environmental impact and contribute to keeping our state clean."

**Government Response:**

The court has urged the Himachal Pradesh government to draft and implement a policy that mandates the distribution and use of garbage bags by tourists. This policy would require tourists to carry a garbage bag for disposing of their waste, which can be handed over at designated collection points upon their departure.

**Tourism and Environmental Impact:**

Himachal Pradesh, renowned for its breathtaking landscapes and serene environment, attracts millions of tourists annually. However, the influx of visitors has also led to an increase in littering, which adversely affects the region's pristine environment and wildlife. By adopting a proactive approach to waste management, the state aims to balance tourism with ecological preservation.

Environmental activists and local communities have lauded the court's suggestion. "This is a positive step towards sustainable tourism," said Anjali Sharma, an environmental activist based in Shimla. "Tourists should be aware of their environmental footprint, and this initiative will encourage them to act responsibly."

**Future Measures:**

The court has also recommended that the state government launch awareness campaigns to educate tourists about the importance of waste management and environmental conservation. Additionally, the government is advised to enhance waste collection and disposal infrastructure in tourist areas to support this initiative.

If implemented effectively, this measure could serve as a model for other states grappling with similar challenges, promoting a culture of responsible tourism across India.

**Conclusion:**

The Himachal Pradesh High Court's suggestion marks a significant step towards sustainable tourism, aiming to protect and preserve the state's natural heritage. By mandating tourists to carry garbage bags, the state government hopes to instill a sense of responsibility among visitors, ensuring that the breathtaking landscapes of Himachal Pradesh remain unspoiled for future generations.
