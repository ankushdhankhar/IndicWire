**Sweden Accuses Iran of Hacking in Response to Qur’an Burnings**

**Stockholm, September 24, 2024** – Swedish prosecutors have accused Iran’s intelligence service of orchestrating a hacking operation in 2023 aimed at fueling societal division in Sweden. The hack, which targeted an SMS operator, resulted in the mass distribution of revenge incitements following protests that involved the desecration of the Qur'an.

The Swedish prosecution authority confirmed that 15,000 messages were sent during the summer of 2023, urging recipients to retaliate against those involved in the Qur’an burnings. "The aim was to create division in Swedish society," the authority said, indicating that the messages were part of a broader campaign to stir conflict within the country. The desecrations, which led to widespread protests, had already placed significant strain on Sweden's relationship with Muslim communities and several Middle Eastern nations.

Sweden’s intelligence service, Sapo, further revealed that the hacker group responsible for the operation had acted on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Fredrik Hallström, chief of operations at Sapo, commented that the campaign was designed to portray Sweden as an Islamophobic country, exacerbating tensions and stoking anti-Swedish sentiment.

The incident highlights the growing concern about foreign cyber operations being used as tools of influence in internal matters. Tensions between Sweden and Muslim-majority nations had escalated in 2023, following the public burning of Qur’ans by far-right groups. The Iranian government had condemned Sweden for allowing such acts, which it viewed as deeply offensive to the Muslim world.

Swedish authorities have stated that investigations into the hacking are ongoing, and they are working with international partners to further assess the extent of the Iranian involvement in the cyber operation. The diplomatic fallout between Sweden and Iran has yet to be fully resolved, with both nations grappling with the implications of this hacking campaign on their bilateral relations.
