**Rahul Gandhi Promises to Be the Voice of J&K in Parliament, Condemns Union Territory Status**

**Srinagar, September 23, 2024**: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi assured the people of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) that he would be their voice in Parliament, vowing to fight for their rights and restore justice to the region. Addressing a large gathering during his visit to the Union Territory, Gandhi reiterated his stance that the downgrading of J&K to a Union Territory in 2019 was a grave injustice to its people, one that has adversely impacted their political representation and autonomy.

In his address, Rahul Gandhi said, *"Jammu and Kashmir is not just a piece of land; it is a symbol of India's unity. Downgrading its status to a Union Territory was an insult to the aspirations of its people. I stand with you, and I will raise your concerns in Parliament, demanding the restoration of your statehood and rightful democratic privileges."* 

This is Gandhi’s latest intervention in the ongoing debate surrounding the region’s status. The abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which resulted in the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories—J&K and Ladakh—has been a contentious issue, drawing widespread criticism from opposition parties.

During his visit, Rahul Gandhi also highlighted the struggles faced by the people of the region due to the prolonged restrictions imposed post-Article 370's abrogation, which affected the economy, tourism, and daily life. He emphasized the need for development, education, and job creation, adding that restoring statehood is crucial for ensuring proper democratic governance and the dignity of the people.

The Congress leader's outreach to J&K comes at a time when the region is preparing for elections, and political parties are mobilizing to gain support. By pledging to champion the region's cause, Gandhi aims to strengthen his party’s presence in the upcoming electoral battle.

**Background**: The removal of J&K’s special status and its reorganization as a Union Territory under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government has been a subject of ongoing debate. The Modi government has defended the move as necessary for integrating the region more effectively into the Indian Union, while opposition parties, particularly the Congress, have called for the restoration of full statehood.

Rahul Gandhi’s visit marks a continued effort by the Congress to re-engage with the people of J&K, promising to bring their issues to national attention. He assured that the Congress would continue to advocate for the region's political and developmental needs in the national discourse.

The Congress leader ended his speech with a call for unity and peace, urging the people of J&K to continue their fight for justice through democratic means. *"I will not rest until Jammu and Kashmir regains its rightful status,"* he said.

**Conclusion**: Rahul Gandhi's promise to be the voice of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in Parliament has re-energized political discourse in the region. His statements reflect the Congress party’s ongoing opposition to the 2019 decision to downgrade J&K’s status, setting the stage for a renewed political battle over the future of the region.
