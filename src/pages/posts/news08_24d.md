**Amit Shah Asserts Naxalism Will Be Eradicated by 2026: "Time for Final Assault"**

*New Delhi, August 24, 2024* — Union Home Minister Amit Shah has vowed to eradicate the naxalism menace by 2026, describing it as the "biggest challenge" for India’s democratic system. Addressing a gathering on Saturday, Shah emphasized the government's commitment to eliminating this internal security threat, which has claimed approximately 17,000 lives over the past four decades.

### The Scale of the Challenge

In his address, Amit Shah outlined the severe impact of naxalism on the country, noting that it has plagued multiple states, particularly in the central and eastern regions, for decades. The insurgency, which began in the late 1960s, was rooted in the socio-economic struggles of marginalized communities but has since evolved into a violent insurgency. Over 17,000 people, including civilians, security personnel, and naxal insurgents, have lost their lives due to the conflict.

Shah highlighted the challenges faced by security forces in combating this insurgency, which thrives in densely forested regions with difficult terrains. Despite these challenges, he asserted that the tide has turned in favor of the government due to strategic initiatives and strong political will.

### Government’s Strategy and Achievements

The Union Minister credited the success in the fight against naxalism to a multi-pronged approach involving aggressive military operations, development initiatives, and improved intelligence sharing among states. "We have already reduced the influence of naxalites from 96 districts in 2010 to 25 districts in 2023," Shah stated, underscoring the significant decline in naxal activities.

Shah also pointed out the various socio-economic programs introduced by the government aimed at addressing the root causes of naxalism, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of basic amenities. Initiatives like road construction, educational facilities, and healthcare improvements in affected areas have played a crucial role in winning the hearts and minds of the local population, weakening the support base of naxalites.

### The Final Assault

Amit Shah termed the next two years as crucial in the battle against naxalism, calling it the "final assault." He announced the launch of intensified operations, with a focus on the remaining strongholds of naxal insurgents. The government plans to deploy additional forces, enhance coordination between central and state agencies, and use advanced technology, including drones and surveillance equipment, to root out the last vestiges of the insurgency.

"We are in the last phase of this fight. The government is fully prepared, and by 2026, we will eliminate naxalism from the face of India," Shah declared.

### Political and Social Implications

The Home Minister’s statement has garnered mixed reactions. While many have lauded the government’s commitment and the progress made so far, some experts have cautioned against declaring victory prematurely. They argue that while military successes are significant, the underlying socio-economic issues that fuel naxalism still need sustained attention.

Opposition leaders have also expressed concerns about the potential for human rights violations during intensified operations. They urge the government to ensure that the final assault is conducted with a focus on minimizing civilian casualties and respecting the rights of those in affected regions.

### Conclusion

As the government gears up for what Amit Shah has termed the "final assault" on naxalism, the nation watches closely. The elimination of this long-standing internal threat could significantly bolster India’s internal security and pave the way for more robust economic development in previously affected regions. However, the success of this mission will depend on the careful balance of force and development, ensuring that peace is achieved sustainably and inclusively.
