### **First Meeting of Parliament Panel on Waqf Bill Underway: Key Discussions and Concerns**

**New Delhi, August 22, 2024** â€” The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment convened its first meeting today to deliberate on the proposed amendments to the Waqf Bill, marking a significant step in the ongoing legislative process. The bill, which seeks to reform the management and regulation of Waqf properties across India, has been a subject of considerable debate, given its potential impact on Muslim community trusts and the broader religious endowments landscape.

#### **Key Objectives of the Waqf Bill**

The Waqf Bill aims to address longstanding issues surrounding the administration of Waqf properties, which are religious endowments set aside for charitable purposes under Islamic law. The bill proposes several changes, including:

1. **Strengthening Waqf Boards:** The bill seeks to enhance the powers of state Waqf boards, enabling them to have greater autonomy in managing Waqf properties. This includes stricter oversight mechanisms to prevent the mismanagement and illegal transfer of Waqf lands.
  
2. **Transparency and Accountability:** The bill introduces provisions for better transparency in the administration of Waqf assets. It mandates the regular auditing of Waqf properties and the public disclosure of financial statements.

3. **Protection of Waqf Properties:** One of the significant amendments includes stringent measures to safeguard Waqf lands from encroachments and unauthorized transactions. The bill proposes heavier penalties for those found guilty of such activities.

4. **Dispute Resolution Mechanisms:** The bill outlines the establishment of dedicated Waqf tribunals at the state level to expedite the resolution of disputes related to Waqf properties, thereby reducing the backlog of cases in regular courts.

#### **Meeting Proceedings: Diverse Views and Concerns**

The committee's first meeting saw robust participation from various stakeholders, including members of Parliament, representatives of state Waqf boards, and experts in Islamic law. The discussions were characterized by a range of opinions, reflecting the diverse perspectives on the proposed legislation.

- **Support for Reform:** Several committee members expressed their support for the bill, emphasizing the need for reform in Waqf management to prevent misuse of properties and ensure they serve their intended charitable purposes. They highlighted cases where Waqf properties had been illegally sold or encroached upon, leading to significant losses for the community.

- **Concerns About Autonomy:** Some members raised concerns about the potential centralization of power under the new bill, arguing that it could undermine the autonomy of state Waqf boards. They stressed the importance of maintaining a balance between oversight and local control to ensure that the unique needs of different regions are addressed.

- **Impact on the Muslim Community:** Representatives from the Muslim community voiced apprehensions about how the bill might affect the traditional role of Waqf in community welfare. They called for greater consultation with religious scholars and community leaders to ensure that the amendments align with Islamic principles.

- **Calls for Clarification:** There were also calls for clearer definitions and guidelines within the bill to avoid ambiguities that could lead to legal challenges. Some members suggested that the bill should include provisions for capacity-building initiatives to empower Waqf boards and ensure they have the necessary expertise to manage properties effectively.

#### **Next Steps: Public Consultations and Revisions**

The committee decided to hold a series of public consultations in the coming weeks to gather feedback from various stakeholders, including religious leaders, legal experts, and the general public. These consultations will be crucial in refining the bill and addressing the concerns raised during the meeting.

The chairperson of the committee emphasized the importance of a thorough and inclusive legislative process, noting that the Waqf Bill has the potential to significantly impact the management of religious endowments in India. The committee is expected to submit its report with recommendations to the Parliament in the upcoming winter session.

As the debate on the Waqf Bill continues, it remains a focal point of interest for both lawmakers and the broader Muslim community, who are keen to see how the proposed changes will shape the future of Waqf properties in the country.
