**Date:** September 10, 2024

**Location:** Imphal, Manipur

**Summary:**
Tensions escalated in Imphal West today as students from Manipur University clashed with security forces in the Kakwa area. The confrontation occurred despite a strict curfew imposed in the region, adding to the growing unrest in the state.

**Details:**

Clashes between students from Manipur University and security forces erupted today in the Kakwa locality of Imphal West, intensifying the already volatile situation in the region. The incident took place in the early hours of the day, with reports of tear gas and baton charges used by security forces to disperse the protesting students.

**Background:**

The clash is the latest in a series of confrontations between civilians and security forces in Manipur, where tensions have been high due to ongoing ethnic and political unrest. The state has been under curfew for several days as authorities attempt to quell the violence and maintain order. However, the imposition of the curfew has been met with resistance from various groups, including students, who have taken to the streets to voice their grievances.

**The Incident:**

According to eyewitness accounts, the students were protesting against alleged police brutality and demanding justice for a recent incident involving a fellow student. The protest soon turned violent as security forces attempted to break up the gathering, leading to a full-scale confrontation. Videos circulating on social media show chaotic scenes, with students hurling stones and security personnel responding with tear gas and lathi charges.

Several students were reportedly injured in the clashes, with some requiring medical attention. The exact number of casualties is still being verified.

**Response:**

Authorities have condemned the violence, reiterating the need for peace and dialogue. They have also warned of strict action against those involved in the clashes, emphasizing that the curfew is in place to ensure public safety.

On the other hand, student leaders have accused the security forces of using excessive force and vowed to continue their protest until their demands are met. They argue that the curfew has only exacerbated the situation and that peaceful dialogue is the only solution to the ongoing crisis.

**Current Situation:**

The situation in Kakwa remains tense, with a heavy security presence in the area. The curfew is expected to remain in effect, with authorities urging residents to stay indoors and avoid any gatherings that could lead to further violence.

The Manipur state government is reportedly monitoring the situation closely and may call for additional measures to restore peace in the region. Meanwhile, student organizations are planning further protests, setting the stage for potential further confrontations in the days to come.

**Conclusion:**

The clash between Manipur University students and security forces in Kakwa underscores the deep-seated tensions in Manipur, where ongoing unrest continues to challenge the efforts of authorities to maintain law and order. As both sides brace for further developments, the need for peaceful resolution and dialogue becomes increasingly critical.
