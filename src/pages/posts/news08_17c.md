### Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder: NCW Highlights Security Lapses and Possible Evidence Tampering at RG Kar Medical College

**Kolkata, August 17, 2024** – The National Commission for Women (NCW) has raised serious concerns over the investigation into the horrific rape and murder of a trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The NCW’s inquiry has uncovered significant lapses in security, infrastructure, and the handling of the crime scene, which could have compromised the investigation.

#### **Security Failures and Lack of Infrastructure**

The NCW's investigation revealed that the incident occurred in an environment severely lacking in basic security measures. The inquiry noted the alarming absence of security guards during the night of the incident, leaving on-call interns, doctors, and nurses vulnerable. This lack of protection during night shifts, according to the NCW, represents a grave failure on the part of the hospital administration to ensure the safety of its staff, particularly women.

Additionally, the hospital’s infrastructure for female medical staff was found to be grossly inadequate. The NCW reported that the hospital's facilities, including washrooms, were poorly maintained, with inadequate lighting further exacerbating the unsafe environment. The absence of security measures and proper amenities raises significant concerns about the working conditions for women at the hospital.

#### **Possible Evidence Tampering and Flaws in Investigation**

The NCW’s report also pointed to potential evidence tampering, which could severely hinder the investigation. According to the NCW, the crime scene, where the rape and murder allegedly took place, was undergoing sudden renovations shortly after the incident. The commission emphasized that the area should have been sealed off immediately by the police to preserve any evidence that could aid in the investigation. The failure to do so raises questions about the integrity of the investigation process.

In addition to these concerns, the NCW highlighted deficiencies in the ongoing investigation. The panel expressed dissatisfaction with the incomplete questioning of Dr. Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, who resigned following the incident. The NCW’s preliminary report indicates that Dr. Ghosh’s testimony could be crucial to understanding the circumstances surrounding the crime, and the incomplete questioning suggests a lack of thoroughness in the investigative process.

#### **Call for Immediate Action**

The NCW’s findings have sparked outrage and demands for immediate action. The commission has called on the West Bengal government and law enforcement agencies to address the serious lapses identified in their report. There is growing pressure on the authorities to ensure a thorough and transparent investigation that brings the perpetrators to justice and addresses the systemic failures that allowed such a crime to occur.

The incident has also reignited discussions about the need for improved security and working conditions for medical professionals, particularly women, in public hospitals across India. The tragic death of the trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College is not just a singular event but a reflection of broader issues of safety and gender equity in the workplace.

The NCW’s final report on the incident is expected to include further recommendations for systemic changes to prevent such tragedies in the future. As the investigation continues, there is a collective call for accountability and justice for the victim, whose untimely death has shocked the nation.
