**Gunfight Erupts in J&K's Udhampur, 4 Jaish-e-Mohammed Terrorists Trapped**

*Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir (September 11, 2024)* â€“ A fierce gunfight erupted early Wednesday morning between security forces and militants in the Basantgarh area of Udhampur district in Jammu and Kashmir. According to a defense spokesperson, four heavily armed terrorists belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group are currently trapped in the area.

The confrontation began after a joint search operation was launched in Kathua district, based on specific intelligence inputs regarding the presence of militants. The operation, involving personnel from the Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police, and paramilitary forces, was focused on the Kathua-Basantgarh border.

"Upon establishing contact with the terrorists at the Kathua-Basantgarh border, an intense gunfight ensued," the defense spokesperson confirmed. The trapped militants are reported to be part of a larger group that infiltrated into the region in recent weeks.

Security forces have cordoned off the area, and reinforcements have been dispatched to prevent any escape attempts by the militants. The operation is ongoing, with the security forces exercising caution to avoid civilian casualties in the area.

This development marks the latest in a series of encounters between security forces and militants in Jammu and Kashmir, where the Jaish-e-Mohammed group remains active. The situation in the region has been tense, with increased infiltration attempts and security operations over the past few months.

Further details on the outcome of the encounter are awaited, as the situation remains fluid.
