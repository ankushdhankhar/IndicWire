1. **Legal Recognition for Live-In Relationships**:
   - The UCC draft provides legal recognition to **live-in relationships**. This means that couples who choose to live together without formal marriage will have legal rights and responsibilities similar to those of married couples.
   - Additionally, children born out of such live-in relationships will be considered **legitimate** under the UCC.

2. **Ban on Polygamy**:
   - The final draft of the UCC explicitly **bans polygamy**. This means that individuals will not be allowed to have multiple spouses simultaneously.
   - This provision aims to promote monogamy and ensure equality within marriages.

3. **Exemption for Scheduled Tribes (STs)**:
   - The UCC includes an exemption for **Scheduled Tribes (STs)** from certain provisions. This recognizes the unique cultural practices and traditions of ST communities.
   - By allowing exemptions, the UCC acknowledges the diversity of personal laws across different communities.

4. **Historical Significance**:
   - If implemented, **Uttarakhand** will become the **first state in India** after Independence to adopt the UCC. This move signifies a significant step toward legal uniformity.
   - It's worth noting that a UCC has been operational in the state of **Goa** since the days of Portuguese rule.

5. **Assembly Session and Security Measures**:
   - The special assembly session, which began on **February 5** and will continue till **February 8**, is being closely monitored.
   - Security has been heightened around the Assembly premises during this critical period.

The UCC aims to bring **uniformity in personal laws** across different religious and cultural communities, promoting equality and justice. As the legislative process unfolds, all eyes are on Uttarakhand to see how this historic development shapes the legal landscape in the state. ðŸŒŸðŸ“œ
