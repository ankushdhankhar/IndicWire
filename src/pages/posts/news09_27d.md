**Tirupati Laddu Controversy: Ex-CM Jagan Reddy Cancels Temple Visit, Cites Denial of Permission**

*Andhra Pradesh - September 27, 2024:* Former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has made headlines once again after canceling his scheduled visit to the Tirumala Tirupati temple, claiming that he was denied permission to offer prayers at the holy site. The development has stirred controversy, leading to sharp political debates in Andhra Pradesh.

### Denial of Permission Sparks Outrage

Jagan Reddy, who had planned a visit to offer prayers and participate in the temple’s annual Brahmotsavam festival, took to social media to express his disappointment. In a statement, the former CM alleged that despite his repeated efforts to secure permission, the authorities failed to respond, effectively preventing his visit. His supporters have since accused the state government, led by the YSRCP’s political rival, of politicizing religious traditions.

### Temple Authorities Respond

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Board, responsible for managing the temple, issued a clarification, stating that the current rules for visiting the temple are stringent due to the ongoing Brahmotsavam celebrations. They emphasized that while the temple welcomes all devotees, large gatherings and political visits must be planned and coordinated in advance due to security concerns. They denied any political motive behind the alleged denial of permission.

### Section 30 of the Police Act Enforced

Meanwhile, local police authorities have cited Section 30 of the Indian Police Act, which prohibits any unauthorized meetings, rallies, or processions near the temple premises without prior approval. The district administration warned that action will be taken against anyone violating the act. This law is typically enforced during major festivals to ensure the smooth flow of pilgrims and to prevent any potential law and order issues.

"Action will be taken against those violating Section 30 of the Police Act," said a senior police officer. "Our priority is to maintain the sanctity of the temple and manage the influx of devotees during this busy period."

### Political Fallout

The incident has quickly gained political traction, with Jagan Reddy’s supporters alleging a deliberate attempt to marginalize him. His party, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), has criticized the state government for mishandling the situation and demanded an official explanation.

In response, TDP leaders have dismissed the allegations, calling them baseless. They emphasized that the TTD Board functions independently and denied any interference from the government in religious matters.

### Conclusion

As the controversy unfolds, the Tirupati Laddu issue has become yet another battleground in the ongoing political rivalry between Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and the state’s ruling TDP. While the temple authorities insist on maintaining order during the festival, the incident has exposed underlying tensions between the former CM and the current administration.
