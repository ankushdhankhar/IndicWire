# Young Volunteers Combining Tradition and Training to Battle Forest Fires

## Introduction

Forest fires pose a significant threat to our environment, wildlife, and communities. In recent years, young volunteers across India have stepped up to protect their land from these devastating fires. By blending traditional wisdom with modern training, these heroes are making a remarkable difference. In this report, we explore their efforts, challenges, and impact.

## The Hidden Tragedy

In the serene village of Chwara in Uttarakhand's Pauri Garhwal district, a group of boys ventured into the nearby forest one fateful summer evening. Their mission: to graze their livestock. Little did they know that tragedy awaited them. The forest was ablaze, and chaos ensued. Villagers scrambled to save their homes, livestock, and precious resources. Some children returned from the burning forest with severe burns, and their goats had perished. Sadly, this scenario repeats almost every year in Uttarakhand.

## The Forest Fire Crisis

In 2022, Uttarakhand witnessed a staggering 1,443 forest fire incidents. These blazes affected over 2,400 hectares of forest area, resulting in an economic loss exceeding Rs 60 lakh. The situation demanded urgent action.

## Pritam Singh: A Local Hero

Pritam Singh, a 21-year-old resident of Chwara, decided to take matters into his own hands. Unlike many young people who migrate to cities seeking better opportunities, Pritam chose to stay in his native village after completing his higher studies. Armed with a Bachelor of Arts degree, he volunteered to become a firefighter. Growing up in Pauri Garhwal, he had witnessed numerous forest fires, including the devastating 2022 blazes.

## Vulnerable Pine Trees

The forests of Uttarakhand are rich in Chir Pine trees, which contain organic polymers. Unfortunately, this makes them highly susceptible to catching fire. According to the Forest Survey of India, more than one-third of Uttarakhand's forest cover is prone to fires. Pritam understood the urgency of protecting their land.

## The Hans Foundation's Initiative

Enter The Hans Foundation (THF), a community-driven organization committed to reducing forest fire incidents. THF enlisted young volunteers like Pritam, providing them with comprehensive training to tackle forest fires. Their initiative covered 1,000 villages across 10 development blocks in Pauri Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal, Almora, and Bageshwar districts.

## Training the Next Generation

THF's intervention resulted in 5,066 young firefighters receiving specialized training. These volunteers learned firefighting techniques, fireline maintenance, and prevention strategies. Armed with knowledge and determination, they became the first line of defense against forest fires.

## Odisha's Kandhamal District

Meanwhile, in Odisha's Kandhamal district, youth volunteers from Kudupakia village devised an alarm system to combat forest fires. Recognizing that 90% of these fires are manmade, they engaged over 100 squads alongside regular staff to mitigate the crisis.

## The Battle Continues

From leaf blowers to beating branches, volunteers across India fight relentlessly against forest fires. In Similipal National Park, women throw their dupattas over their shoulders, sweat dripping, as they battle flames with leafy branches. Their determination exemplifies the spirit of these unsung heroes.

## Conclusion

Young volunteers, armed with both ancient wisdom and modern techniques, are rewriting the narrative of forest fire prevention. Their commitment to protecting our natural heritage is commendable. As we celebrate their efforts, let us recognize that the battle against forest fires is ongoing. Together, we can safeguard our forests and ensure a greener, safer future for generations to come.
