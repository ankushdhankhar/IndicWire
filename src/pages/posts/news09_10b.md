### Farmers in Karnataka Urge Government to Frame Policy on Desilting Dams and Water Bodies

**Date:** September 10, 2024  
**Location:** Bengaluru, Karnataka

Farmers across Karnataka have called on the state government to implement a comprehensive policy to desilt dams and water bodies, a measure they believe is crucial for improving water storage capacity and providing a sustainable source of organic manure. The farmers argue that the accumulated silt in these water bodies has not only reduced their water retention capacity but also deprived them of a valuable resource that could be repurposed to enhance soil fertility in agricultural lands.

#### **The Proposal: Silt as Manure**

The farmers have proposed a two-pronged approach to address the issue. First, they are urging the government to undertake regular desilting of dams, tanks, and other water bodies across the state. Second, they suggest that the silt removed during this process be distributed to farmers free of charge or at a nominal cost, to be used as manure.

Silt, which is rich in minerals and organic matter, has been recognized for its potential to improve soil quality. Many farmers believe that incorporating silt into their fields could help restore the soil's fertility, reduce dependency on chemical fertilizers, and ultimately lead to better crop yields.

#### **Benefits of Desilting**

1. **Increased Water Storage:** Desilting dams and water bodies would increase their capacity to store water, which is especially critical in a state like Karnataka that frequently faces water scarcity. Improved water storage could ensure better availability of water for irrigation, particularly during dry spells.
  
2. **Soil Fertility:** The silt, which accumulates over time in water bodies, is a valuable source of nutrients for the soil. When used as manure, it can enhance the soil structure, improve moisture retention, and provide essential nutrients to crops, promoting sustainable farming practices.
  
3. **Environmental Impact:** Desilting could also have a positive environmental impact by reducing the risk of flooding. Water bodies with increased storage capacity are less likely to overflow during heavy rains, thus preventing waterlogging and soil erosion.

#### **Farmers’ Demands**

Farmers' associations have put forth a detailed proposal to the Karnataka government, outlining the need for:

- **A State-wide Desilting Policy:** The establishment of a policy that mandates regular desilting of dams and water bodies.
  
- **Financial Support:** Allocation of funds to support desilting operations and the transportation of silt to farmlands.
  
- **Involvement of Local Communities:** Active involvement of local communities and farmers' groups in the desilting process to ensure it is carried out effectively and meets the needs of the farmers.
  
- **Subsidized Distribution of Silt:** The distribution of silt to farmers either free of cost or at a subsidized rate to encourage its use as an organic manure.

#### **Government Response**

As of now, the Karnataka government has acknowledged the farmers' demands and indicated that it is considering the proposal. The state’s Water Resources Department has been directed to conduct a feasibility study on the desilting of major dams and tanks. 

A senior official from the department stated, "We recognize the potential benefits of desilting, not just for water management but also for agriculture. A detailed plan will be developed after consulting with experts and stakeholders."

The government's decision on this matter is eagerly awaited by the farming community, who see it as a potential game-changer for agriculture in the state. If implemented, the policy could serve as a model for other states facing similar challenges, marking a significant step toward sustainable agricultural practices in India.

#### **Conclusion**

The farmers' plea highlights the urgent need for a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to water management in Karnataka. By framing a policy that supports desilting and the use of silt as manure, the government has the opportunity to address multiple issues simultaneously – improving water storage, enhancing soil fertility, and promoting sustainable farming. The outcome of this proposal will be closely watched, not only by farmers in Karnataka but across the country, as it could set a precedent for future agricultural and environmental policies.
