**Controversy Erupts as Muslims Perform Namaz At Golden Temple Premises**

**Amritsar, June 23, 2024** â€” Tensions have escalated in Amritsar as a video surfaced showing a group of Muslims performing Namaz inside the revered Golden Temple premises, sparking a debate on religious protocols and sanctity.

The incident, which occurred during a time of relative calm at the Golden Temple, a significant Sikh shrine, has drawn both condemnation and support from various quarters. The video, widely circulated on social media, captured the Muslims praying peacefully in a secluded area of the temple complex.

Sikh leaders and some devotees have expressed outrage, citing the Golden Temple's historical significance as the holiest Gurdwara and a symbol of Sikh identity. "The sanctity of the Golden Temple must be upheld. Allowing prayers from other faiths compromises its spiritual integrity," remarked Harpreet Singh, a local community leader.

Conversely, others have defended the Muslims' right to pray, emphasizing the principles of inclusivity and religious tolerance. "The Golden Temple has always stood for unity and respect for all religions. Allowing peaceful prayers of other faiths reflects these values," stated Sarabjit Kaur, a social activist.

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the Golden Temple, has yet to issue an official statement. However, sources indicate internal discussions are ongoing to address the incident and prevent similar occurrences in the future.

Meanwhile, authorities are monitoring the situation closely to prevent any potential unrest. Police presence around the Golden Temple has been increased to maintain peace and ensure the safety of visitors.

The incident has reignited broader discussions on religious freedom and the boundaries of interfaith interactions at sacred sites. As the debate continues, both Sikh and Muslim leaders are expected to engage in dialogues to reach a consensus that respects the sensitivities and traditions of all communities involved.

For now, the Golden Temple remains open to visitors, with devotees and tourists continuing to pour in despite the controversy. The long-term implications of this incident on religious practices at the Golden Temple remain uncertain, pending further deliberations and decisions from religious authorities.

This news report attempts to capture the essence of the situation surrounding the controversy of Muslims performing Namaz inside the Golden Temple premises while presenting the perspectives and reactions from different stakeholders.
