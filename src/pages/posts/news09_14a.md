**Terrorist Killed in Baramulla Encounter as Two Army Soldiers Fall in Kishtwar Ahead of PM Modi's Kashmir Visit**

**Date:** September 14, 2024  
**Location:** Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir

In a significant development ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheduled visit to Kashmir today, security forces have neutralized a terrorist in a fierce encounter in the Baramulla district of North Kashmir. The operation, which unfolded early in the morning, highlights ongoing efforts by the Indian Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police to maintain security in the region.

### Baramulla Encounter

The encounter took place in the Sopore area of Baramulla, where a joint team of the Indian Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police launched a cordon-and-search operation based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists. Upon reaching the target location, the security forces came under heavy fire, prompting an intense gunfight. One terrorist was killed in the exchange, and his body, along with an assault rifle and other war-like stores, was recovered from the site. The identity and affiliation of the slain terrorist are yet to be confirmed.

This encounter comes at a time of heightened vigilance in the Kashmir Valley as Prime Minister Modi is expected to visit the region later today to review developmental projects and meet security officials.

### Kishtwar Incident

In a separate tragic event, two Indian Army soldiers were martyred in the Kishtwar district of Jammu on the eve of the Prime Minister's visit. The soldiers were part of a counter-terrorism operation that was initiated after reports surfaced about a terrorist movement in the forested area of Marwah. During the operation, the soldiers were ambushed by militants, resulting in a heavy firefight. Despite fighting valiantly, both soldiers succumbed to their injuries. The militants managed to flee into the dense forests, prompting a manhunt in the region.

### Security Tightened for PM Modi's Visit

As the Prime Minister's visit to Kashmir coincides with these incidents, security measures across Jammu and Kashmir have been ramped up significantly. Additional checkpoints have been established, and drone surveillance has been deployed to monitor sensitive areas. PM Modi is expected to address local leaders, discuss security concerns, and review key development projects during his visit.

Local authorities have urged citizens to remain vigilant and cooperate with the security forces, who are working to ensure the safety and security of the region amid the current situation.

**Background**

The Kashmir region has seen a relative decrease in militant activity in recent months due to intensified operations by the Indian security forces. However, sporadic incidents, including attacks on security personnel and encounters, continue to challenge peace efforts.

PM Modi's visit to Kashmir is seen as part of the government's ongoing push to boost infrastructure and development in the region while addressing security challenges.
