**AAP Convener Arvind Kejriwal to Vacate Delhi CM Residence Tomorrow**

*New Delhi, October 3, 2024* – In a significant development in Delhi’s political circles, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is set to vacate the official Delhi CM residence tomorrow. Kejriwal will shift to a Member of Parliament’s (MP) bungalow located in Lutyens’ Delhi, marking a notable transition in his living arrangements.

This decision comes after a series of discussions within the AAP leadership regarding Kejriwal’s future role as both the Delhi CM and a key national political figure. The shift to an MP's bungalow is expected to offer Kejriwal better access to central political institutions, enabling smoother interactions with national-level leaders and decision-makers as AAP looks to expand its influence beyond Delhi.

The Delhi CM residence at 6, Flagstaff Road, Civil Lines, has been Kejriwal’s home since he assumed office as Chief Minister in 2015. During his tenure, the residence became synonymous with the AAP's governance style, known for its focus on grassroots development, education, and healthcare reforms. 

Sources close to the party suggest that Kejriwal’s relocation is part of a broader strategy, signaling his increasing involvement in national politics. As AAP's national convener, he has been a vocal critic of the BJP and Congress, and his move to Lutyens’ Delhi is expected to bolster his stature on the national stage. His new residence in this politically influential area will position him closer to the Parliament, facilitating greater engagement with legislative affairs.

There has been no official statement from Kejriwal or AAP on the exact reasons behind the move, but insiders indicate that it reflects a natural progression as Kejriwal juggles responsibilities between his role as Delhi's leader and a national political figure. 

As the move is set to take place tomorrow, the political community will be watching closely for any statements or symbolic gestures accompanying this transition.
