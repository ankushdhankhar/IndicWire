### Kolkata Doctor Death: 'Nabanna Abhijan' Protesters Clash With Police in Howrah

**Kolkata, August 27, 2024** — Tensions flared in Howrah today as a large group of protesters, agitated over the death of a doctor under controversial circumstances, clashed with the police during the 'Nabanna Abhijan' march. The march, organized to demand justice for the deceased doctor and to highlight alleged failures in the healthcare system, witnessed intense moments as demonstrators broke through police barricades, leading to a violent confrontation.

#### **The Incident:**
The march, which started peacefully from multiple points in Kolkata, turned chaotic as it approached Howrah. Protesters, many of whom were healthcare workers, students, and members of civil society, accused the state government of negligence and demanded a thorough investigation into the doctor’s death, which they claim was a result of systemic issues in the healthcare infrastructure.

As the procession neared Howrah Bridge, the police had set up multiple barricades to control the crowd and prevent them from reaching the Nabanna building, the state administrative headquarters. However, the protesters, chanting slogans and waving placards, forcefully broke through the barricades, leading to a scuffle with the police.

#### **Violent Clashes:**
Eyewitnesses reported that the situation quickly spiraled out of control. The police, equipped with batons and shields, attempted to disperse the crowd, but the protesters resisted, resulting in violent clashes. Some protesters were seen throwing stones and other objects at the police, while others attempted to push through the remaining barricades.

In response, the police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. The air was thick with tension as the protesters, many covering their faces with cloths, retreated momentarily, only to regroup and attempt to advance again. Several protesters and police personnel were injured in the clashes, with some requiring medical attention.

#### **Government Response:**
The state government, led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, condemned the violence and urged the protesters to maintain peace. In a statement, the government acknowledged the right to protest but criticized the destruction of public property and the attacks on law enforcement officers.

"The right to protest is fundamental, but we cannot condone violence or the endangerment of public safety. We urge all citizens to express their grievances through peaceful and legal means," the statement read.

#### **Protesters' Demands:**
The protesters, however, remain adamant in their demands for justice. They have accused the state government of attempting to suppress their voices and have vowed to continue their agitation until their demands are met. The key demands include an independent investigation into the doctor's death, reforms in the state's healthcare system, and the resignation of key officials they believe are responsible for the alleged negligence.

"We are fighting for justice, not just for one doctor but for the entire healthcare system that is crumbling due to mismanagement and corruption," said one of the protest leaders.

#### **Aftermath:**
As the day progressed, the situation remained tense but under control. Several protesters were detained by the police, and an inquiry has been launched into the incident. Public opinion remains divided, with some supporting the protesters' cause while others condemn the violence.

The events of today have added to the growing unrest in the state, with opposition parties seizing the opportunity to criticize the government. The death of the doctor has become a flashpoint in a broader debate about the state of healthcare in West Bengal, with many demanding systemic changes to prevent such incidents in the future.

#### **Conclusion:**
The 'Nabanna Abhijan' protest has brought the issue of healthcare and public safety to the forefront in West Bengal. As the situation develops, all eyes will be on the state government’s response and the steps it takes to address the protesters' demands and restore calm in the region.
