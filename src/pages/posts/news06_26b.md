**Why apparent silence of the opposition regarding the tragic incident of spurious liquor in Tamil Nadu's Kallakurichi district**

In a devastating turn of events, the death toll resulting from the consumption of spurious liquor in Tamil Nadu's Kallakurichi district has risen sharply to 61. The incident, which unfolded in Karunapuram village on June 18, has left a profound impact on the community, with 118 individuals currently under medical care across various hospitals in the region.

The consumption of illicit liquor, often colloquially referred to as 'hooch', has once again brought to light the dangers associated with the production and distribution of unregulated alcohol. Initial reports suggest that the victims, primarily from marginalized communities, fell ill after consuming the illicit brew, which was allegedly sold at a considerably lower price compared to legally produced alcohol.

Authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident to ascertain the source of the lethal concoction and identify those responsible for its distribution. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has expressed deep sorrow over the tragedy and has assured stringent action against those found guilty of manufacturing and selling the toxic substance.

However, amidst the grief and calls for justice, there has been a noticeable absence of response from the opposition parties. Critics have pointed out the seeming silence from political opponents, questioning their stance on such critical public health issues and their commitment to holding the government accountable for ensuring the safety of citizens.

Local authorities continue to monitor the health condition of those hospitalized and have deployed additional medical personnel to provide necessary care. The tragic incident has sparked widespread outrage and demands for stricter enforcement of laws regulating the production and sale of alcohol to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

As the investigation progresses, the community in Kallakurichi mourns the loss of lives and hopes for swift justice for the victims of this preventable tragedy. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for stringent measures to combat the illegal liquor trade and protect vulnerable communities from such hazardous substances.
