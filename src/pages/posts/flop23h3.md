## Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s continuing silence on Manipur
Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s continuing silence on Manipur, as the latter paid a visit to Assam on Sunday, January 4. It was Modi’s first visit to Northeast India since ethnic conflict broke out in Manipur on May 3 last year.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Khera conveyed to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that if Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma couldn’t organise a chopper for Modi to travel to Imphal from Guwahati, the Congress party could book a ticket for him on a commercial flight. Along with the comment, Khera appended a screenshot of flight options available from Guwahati to Imphal, which show a flight ticket costs as low as Rs 3,000. Khera’s X post attracted 53k views when this copy was being written.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/PMOIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PMOIndia</a>, If Himanta can book a chopper for you then it is fine, otherwise here is the list of flights between Guwahati and Imphal tomorrow. Please let us know if we need to make the booking….. <a href="https://t.co/5ytu06SUKA">https://t.co/5ytu06SUKA</a> <a href="https://t.co/Cc3PHJRqv8">pic.twitter.com/Cc3PHJRqv8</a></p>&mdash; Pawan Khera 🇮🇳 (@Pawankhera) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pawankhera/status/1753976892758143386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As expected, Modi, during the one-and-a-half day visit to Assam, remained silent on Manipur – even though the ethnic conflict in that northeastern state has now taken a fierce turn along India’s border areas with a beleaguered Myanmar. Within Manipur, the state is witness to something unseen till now – it is virtually split into two on ethnic lines. Be it the Kuki or Meitei ethnic community, the areas each lay a claim to are being virulently guarded with gun power by non-state actors while security forces, most times, are mere spectators to the goings-on.

Modi’s silence on the ongoing Manipur violence which has thus far rendered thousands homeless and killed many an innocent is particularly being questioned by the Opposition for shielding N. Biren Singh, a chief minister hand-picked by him and his deputy, the home minister Amit Shah. Shah had also gone to the extent of supporting Singh while placing a statement in parliament on the Manipur violence.

For the last nine months, Prime Minister Modi, while stridently backing Biren Singh, has also disregarded the call from common citizens belonging to both the warring communities of Manipur to visit the state at least once. Members of the civil society have underlined to visiting media persons that Manipur is also a BJP-ruled state where Modi’s party had formed a government on its own for the first time after the last assembly polls.
