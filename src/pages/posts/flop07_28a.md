### Tragic Flooding at Rau's IAS Coaching Centre in Delhi Claims Lives of Three UPSC Aspirants

**New Delhi, July 28, 2024** â€“ In a tragic incident at Rau's IAS Coaching Centre in Old Rajender Nagar, Delhi, three students lost their lives after heavy rainfall flooded the library situated in the basement of the building. The incident occurred last evening, trapping the students while 27 others managed to escape or were rescued by emergency services.

The deceased have been identified as aspirants who were preparing for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examinations, a challenging and highly competitive series of exams that thousands of students across India prepare for each year.

#### Incident Overview

According to eyewitnesses, the heavy downpour began in the late afternoon and continued for several hours, causing significant waterlogging in various parts of the city. The basement of the coaching centre, which houses the library, was quickly inundated with water.

Students present in the library at the time reported that the water level rose rapidly, leaving little time to react. While most of the students managed to escape, three were unable to make it out in time and were tragically trapped inside. The Delhi Fire Service and other emergency responders were alerted, but despite their efforts, the three students could not be saved.

#### Arrests and Legal Actions

Following the incident, the owner and the coordinator of the coaching centre were arrested. Preliminary investigations suggest that the basement library lacked adequate drainage and safety measures, contributing to the severity of the flooding. Authorities are now investigating whether the building's structure and facilities met safety regulations.

#### Student Protests

In the aftermath of the tragedy, students have taken to the streets in protest, demanding justice for the victims and stricter safety regulations for educational institutions. Protesters gathered outside the coaching centre and local government offices, calling for accountability and immediate action to prevent such incidents in the future.

One of the protesting students, Arjun Mehta, said, "This is not just an accident; it is a result of gross negligence. We need stricter regulations and regular inspections to ensure the safety of all students. This cannot happen again."

#### Official Responses

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased and promised a thorough investigation. "This is a heartbreaking incident. We will ensure that those responsible are held accountable, and we will take all necessary steps to improve safety standards in educational institutions across the city," he said in a statement.

The Delhi Fire Service has also announced plans to conduct inspections of all coaching centres in the city to assess their preparedness for emergencies and compliance with safety norms.

#### Community Support

In the wake of the tragedy, the local community has come together to support the affected families. Vigils and prayer meetings are being organized, and a crowdfunding campaign has been initiated to provide financial assistance to the families of the deceased students.

As investigations continue, the incident at Rau's IAS Coaching Centre serves as a grim reminder of the importance of safety measures and regulations in educational institutions. The students' untimely deaths have sparked a broader conversation about the need for systemic changes to protect those who strive for academic success.
