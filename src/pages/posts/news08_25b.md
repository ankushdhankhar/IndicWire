**Pakistan Extends Invitation to PM Modi for SCO Council of Heads of Government Meeting in Islamabad**

In a significant diplomatic move, Pakistan has extended an official invitation to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting scheduled to be held in Islamabad later this year. This development comes at a time when bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries remain tense due to longstanding political and territorial disputes.

The SCO, an intergovernmental organization founded in 2001, focuses on political, economic, and security-related cooperation in Eurasia. The organization comprises eight member states, including China, Russia, India, and Pakistan. The Council of Heads of Government is one of the key bodies of the SCO, responsible for discussing and approving strategies related to trade, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges among member states.

According to diplomatic sources, the invitation was conveyed through formal channels, marking a rare instance of direct diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan. The move is seen as part of Pakistan's broader efforts to uphold its role as a member of the SCO while fostering regional cooperation despite existing tensions with India.

India's Ministry of External Affairs has acknowledged the receipt of the invitation but has yet to confirm whether Prime Minister Modi will attend the meeting. The decision is likely to be influenced by various factors, including the current state of bilateral relations, security concerns, and the broader geopolitical context.

Experts believe that India's response to the invitation will be closely watched by international observers, as it could signal a potential thaw in relations or further entrench the existing stalemate. The SCO platform has historically provided opportunities for India and Pakistan to engage in dialogue, albeit in a multilateral setting, and this invitation could serve as a litmus test for the future of India-Pakistan relations.

The last time a high-level Indian official visited Pakistan was in 2016 when then-External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj attended the Heart of Asia conference in Islamabad. Since then, diplomatic ties have remained largely strained, with both countries frequently exchanging accusations over cross-border terrorism and territorial disputes, particularly in the Kashmir region.

As the SCO CHG meeting approaches, all eyes will be on New Delhi to see how it navigates this complex diplomatic scenario. A decision to participate could open the door to renewed dialogue, while a refusal might deepen the rift between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.
