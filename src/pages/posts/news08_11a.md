**Existence of 'mini-Bangladeshes' in several districts of Assam**

**Date: August 11, 2024**

**Location: Guwahati, Assam**

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has stirred a political controversy with his recent remarks about the existence of "mini-Bangladeshes" in several districts of Assam. The statement, made during a public address, has drawn criticism and sparked a debate on demographic changes and illegal immigration in the region.

**Details of the Statement:**

During a public event in Guwahati, CM Sarma claimed that certain districts in Assam have become "mini-Bangladeshes" due to the significant influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. He expressed concerns over the demographic changes in these areas and emphasized the need for strict measures to address the issue.

Sarma stated, "There are several districts in Assam where the indigenous population feels threatened by the rapid demographic changes. We cannot ignore the reality that these areas are turning into mini-Bangladeshes."

**Political Reactions:**

The Chief Minister's remarks have elicited strong reactions from political leaders and organizations across the spectrum. The opposition parties, including the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), criticized Sarma's comments as divisive and inflammatory.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assam Legislative Assembly, Debabrata Saikia, accused Sarma of using inflammatory rhetoric to divert attention from the state's pressing issues. He said, "Instead of addressing the real challenges faced by the people of Assam, the Chief Minister is resorting to divisive politics."

AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal also condemned the statement, urging the government to focus on development and harmony rather than creating communal tensions.

**Public Response:**

The remarks have triggered mixed reactions among the public. While some support Sarma's stance on addressing illegal immigration, others express concern about the potential for communal disharmony. Social media platforms are abuzz with debates, with many users sharing their opinions on the issue.

Local residents in the districts mentioned by the Chief Minister have expressed a range of views. Some individuals acknowledge the demographic changes but emphasize the importance of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among communities.

**Government's Position:**

In response to the backlash, the Assam government has clarified its position, stating that the Chief Minister's remarks were intended to highlight the challenges posed by illegal immigration and the need for effective policy measures. The government emphasized its commitment to safeguarding the rights and interests of indigenous communities while ensuring social harmony.

**Conclusion:**

The controversy surrounding CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's "mini-Bangladeshes" comment underscores the sensitive nature of the issue of illegal immigration in Assam. As the state grapples with demographic changes and their implications, political leaders and citizens alike must navigate the complex terrain of identity, security, and coexistence.

**Future Implications:**

The Chief Minister's remarks may have far-reaching implications for the political landscape in Assam, particularly as the state approaches the upcoming assembly elections. The issue of illegal immigration is likely to remain a focal point in political discourse, influencing electoral strategies and public sentiment.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how the Assam government will address the concerns raised by various stakeholders and work towards a balanced approach that respects the rights of all communities while addressing security and demographic challenges.
