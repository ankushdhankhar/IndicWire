# UN General Assembly Adopts Resolution on Combating Islamophobia: India's Abstention Sparks Debate


**New York, March 19, 2024** — In a significant development at the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution titled "Measures to Combat Islamophobia" was adopted with overwhelming support from member nations. However, India's decision to abstain from voting has sparked intense debate and raised critical questions about the broader issue of religious intolerance.

## The Resolution and Its Context

The resolution, co-sponsored by Pakistan and China, aimed to address the rising incidents of Islamophobia worldwide. It called for concerted efforts to combat discrimination, hate speech, and violence against Muslims. While the resolution received widespread endorsement, India's abstention has drawn attention to the complexities of religious intolerance beyond Islam.

## India's Stand: Beyond Islamophobia

India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj, delivered a powerful statement during the General Assembly session. She emphasized that religious discrimination is not limited to any single faith and extends across various religions. Kamboj's speech highlighted the following key points:

1. **Religiophobia Knows No Boundaries**: Kamboj asserted that acts of hatred and discrimination are not exclusive to Islam. Followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, have also faced religiophobia over decades. By abstaining from the vote, India sought to emphasize this broader perspective.

2. **Contemporary Manifestations**: The Ambassador pointed out that contemporary manifestations of religiophobia are evident across the globe. Attacks on religious sites, such as Gurudwaras, monasteries, and temples, have affected Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs. Hate speech and misinformation targeting non-Abrahamic religions persist, necessitating a comprehensive approach.

3. **Recognizing All Faiths**: Kamboj urged the international community to recognize that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism are equally susceptible to religious intolerance. While addressing Islamophobia is crucial, neglecting the challenges faced by other religions perpetuates feelings of exclusion and inequality.

## Global Reactions

The resolution received support from 115 nations, with none opposing it. However, 44 countries, including India, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Ukraine, and the UK, chose to abstain. Their decision reflects a nuanced stance—one that acknowledges the urgency of addressing Islamophobia while advocating for a holistic approach to religiophobia.

## Implications and Future Steps

The adoption of the resolution sends a strong message against Islamophobia, but it also opens doors for broader discussions. As the international community grapples with religious intolerance, Ambassador Kamboj's call for inclusivity resonates. The challenge lies in finding common ground—a path that recognizes the unique struggles of each faith while promoting unity and understanding.

In the aftermath of this resolution, the UN and member states must engage in dialogue to develop actionable strategies. The fight against religiophobia demands collective efforts, transcending borders and religious boundaries.

## Conclusion

India's abstention has ignited conversations about the interconnectedness of religious discrimination. As the world confronts hatred and prejudice, it is essential to recognize that no faith exists in isolation. By addressing religiophobia comprehensively, we can build a more tolerant and harmonious global society—one that respects all beliefs and fosters mutual respect.
