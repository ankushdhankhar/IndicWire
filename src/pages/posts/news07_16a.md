### Tragic Encounter in Jammu and Kashmir: Four Indian Army Soldiers Killed in Doda

In a tragic incident in Jammu and Kashmir's Doda district, four Indian Army soldiers, including an officer, lost their lives following a gunfight with terrorists. The encounter, which unfolded on Monday night, involved joint forces comprising the Rashtriya Rifles and the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the J&K Police. The operation was initiated based on specific intelligence about terrorist presence in the Desa forest area near Dhari Gote Urarbagi.

The confrontation began around 7:45 pm when the security forces commenced a cordon and search operation. The operation quickly escalated into a fierce gunfight lasting over 20 minutes. Major Brijesh Thappa of the 10th Rashtriya Rifles, who had recently been promoted, was among the fallen. Details about the other casualties have not yet been disclosed. Five security personnel, including Major Thappa, sustained critical injuries during the initial exchange of fire and were rushed to the hospital, where they were later pronounced dead.
