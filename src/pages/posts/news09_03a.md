**Pregnant Para-archer Jodie Grinham and Nathan Macqueen clinched gold for Great Britain by beating Iran 155-151 in the mixed team compound final**

In a stunning display of skill and determination, Great Britain secured a gold medal in the mixed team compound final at the Para-Archery World Championships in Paris. The British duo, consisting of Jodie Grinham and Nathan Macqueen, emerged victorious against Iran with a final score of 155-151. The victory marks an especially remarkable achievement for Grinham, who is seven months pregnant, and comes on the heels of her bronze medal win in the women's individual compound event earlier in the competition.

### A Thrilling Final

The final match against Iran proved to be a nail-biter, with the British pair leading by just one point (39-38) after the first end. The competition intensified as the scores were tied at 77-77 at the halfway point, setting the stage for a tense second half. However, a couple of 8s from Iran's Hadi Nori in the third end provided Great Britain with a crucial two-point advantage (115-113) going into the final round.

In the last end, Grinham and Macqueen showcased their composure and precision under pressure, delivering a perfect score of 40 to secure the gold medal. Their performance in the final round not only secured their victory but also demonstrated the high level of teamwork and concentration that characterized their entire campaign.

### A Second Medal for Grinham

For Jodie Grinham, the gold medal represents her second podium finish in Paris. Just days before the mixed team event, she competed against her British teammate Phoebe Paterson Pine in the women's individual compound bronze medal match, where she secured the third spot on the podium. Grinhamâ€™s accomplishments are all the more impressive given her current physical condition, as she is seven months into her pregnancy.

Reflecting on her victory, Grinham, 31, shared her emotional response to the win. "All I wanted to do at the end was jump up and down and cry and scream and shout," she told BBC Wales. "But being heavily pregnant, realistically the best thing to do was crouch down and take a second, and then I could give hugs and things." Grinham, who previously won a silver medal in the compound team event with John Stubbs at the 2016 Paralympics, described the emotional moment as akin to "being a child at Christmas and getting your favourite toy."

### A Historic Achievement for British Para-Archery

The gold medal in Paris is a testament to the strength and depth of British para-archery. Nathan Macqueen, who partnered with Grinham in the mixed team event, also played a critical role in the team's success. His experience and precision helped secure the victory, further establishing Great Britain as a dominant force in the sport.

The triumph in Paris is not only a significant milestone for Grinham and Macqueen but also an inspiration to athletes everywhere, showing that perseverance and teamwork can overcome even the most challenging circumstances. As they return home with their well-deserved medals, the British duo's success will undoubtedly inspire future generations of para-athletes.

This victory adds to the growing legacy of Great Britain's para-archery program and sets a high standard for upcoming competitions, including the Paralympic Games, where the team will undoubtedly aim to replicate their success on the world stage.
