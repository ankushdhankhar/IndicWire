**PM Modi Accuses Congress of Being Run by ‘Tukde Tukde Gang,’ Highlights Success of Vishwakarma Program in Vidarbha Rally**

**Date**: September 21, 2024

**Location**: Vidarbha, Maharashtra

During a massive rally in Vidarbha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on the Congress party, accusing it of being run by the so-called “tukde tukde gang” — a term used by BJP leaders to suggest forces attempting to divide India. Modi criticized the opposition for undermining the nation's unity and trying to create divisions in society.

### **Key Points from Modi’s Speech:**

- **Congress’ Leadership Under Fire**: Referring to the opposition's tactics, PM Modi claimed, "Congress is no longer the party it once was. Today, it’s being run by a tukde tukde gang that is bent on fragmenting the country." He emphasized that the BJP, under his leadership, stands for a united and strong India.
  
- **Vishwakarma Program Success**: Shifting his focus to his government’s achievements, Modi expressed satisfaction over the implementation of the Vishwakarma program. He highlighted how Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) have benefitted from this initiative. "The Vishwakarma program has empowered marginalized communities by providing them with the tools and resources to improve their livelihoods," he said, emphasizing the government's commitment to uplifting these communities.

- **Development in Vidarbha**: Modi also took the opportunity to speak about the development initiatives in Vidarbha, a region often regarded as economically backward. He reassured the crowd that the central government is working to ensure prosperity reaches every corner of Maharashtra.

### **Opposition's Response**:
Congress leaders were quick to respond to Modi's sharp remarks. A spokesperson from the party accused the Prime Minister of diverting attention from the real issues facing the country. "The BJP is trying to distract the public with baseless accusations while failing to address unemployment and inflation," the Congress representative stated.

### **Local Impact**:
In Vidarbha, the Vishwakarma program has provided skill development opportunities for artisans, particularly from rural and economically weaker sections, helping them sustain their traditional crafts. Many locals in the SC, ST, and OBC communities have lauded the scheme, noting that it has given them access to better training, loans, and market access.

### **Political Significance**:
As Maharashtra heads towards elections, PM Modi's remarks are seen as part of the BJP's strategy to solidify its voter base and discredit the opposition. By invoking the ‘tukde tukde gang’ narrative and underscoring the success of welfare programs like Vishwakarma, the Prime Minister aims to build momentum for the party in the state.

### **Conclusion**:
PM Modi’s rally in Vidarbha showcased both his party’s developmental agenda and its aggressive stance against Congress. As political tensions heighten in Maharashtra, the Prime Minister's comments are likely to fuel further debate as the election campaigns progress.
