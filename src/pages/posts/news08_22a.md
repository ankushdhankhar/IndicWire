**PM Modi Advocates UN Reforms During Joint Press Briefing with Polish PM Donald Tusk** 

**Date:** August 22, 2024

**Warsaw, Poland** – In a significant diplomatic move, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, called for urgent reforms in the United Nations and other global institutions to effectively address contemporary geopolitical challenges. The call was made during a joint press briefing held in Warsaw, where the leaders discussed a range of bilateral and international issues.

**Highlighting the Need for UN Reforms**

Prime Minister Modi emphasized that the current global order, established in the aftermath of World War II, is increasingly inadequate in addressing the complexities of today’s geopolitical landscape. "The world has changed significantly, and so have the challenges. The United Nations and other international institutions must evolve to stay relevant and effective," Modi stated.

He pointed out that issues such as terrorism, climate change, and economic inequality require a more responsive and inclusive global governance structure. Modi stressed that emerging economies and developing nations should have a greater say in these institutions to ensure that global decisions are equitable and just.

**Support from Poland**

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed Modi’s sentiments, agreeing that reforms are necessary to maintain global peace and security. Tusk acknowledged that the UN, while still a crucial platform, must adapt to the realities of the 21st century. "Poland stands with India in advocating for a more balanced and representative international system," Tusk added.

**Strengthening Bilateral Relations**

The meeting between the two leaders also focused on strengthening the strategic partnership between India and Poland. Discussions covered a wide range of topics, including trade, defense cooperation, and cultural exchanges. Both leaders expressed optimism about the future of Indo-Polish relations, with a particular focus on enhancing economic ties.

**Global Implications**

Modi’s call for UN reforms aligns with India's long-standing demand for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. As a nation with over a billion people and one of the world's largest economies, India has been advocating for greater representation in global decision-making bodies.

The joint statement by Modi and Tusk is expected to resonate in international forums, potentially reigniting debates over the structure and functioning of the UN and other global institutions. Their unified stance underscores the growing demand for a more democratic and transparent global governance system.

**Conclusion**

As the world grapples with complex challenges, the call for UN reforms by PM Modi and PM Tusk highlights the urgent need for a more inclusive and responsive global order. The meeting in Warsaw marks a significant step in international diplomacy, with both leaders advocating for a future where global institutions are better equipped to address the pressing issues of our time.
