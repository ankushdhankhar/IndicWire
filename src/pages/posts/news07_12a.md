**Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Remains in Jail Despite Interim Bail in PMLA Case**

*New Delhi, July 12, 2024* - In a significant legal development, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind Kejriwal received interim bail from the Supreme Court in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). However, despite this relief, Kejriwal will continue to remain in jail due to his ongoing judicial custody in a separate case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

### Supreme Court Grants Interim Bail

The Supreme Court’s decision to grant interim bail to Kejriwal in the PMLA case brought a temporary respite for the AAP leader. The court acknowledged the arguments presented by Kejriwal's legal team, which emphasized the lack of substantial evidence linking him directly to money laundering activities. The bench, led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, ruled that Kejriwal could not be detained indefinitely without concrete evidence and thus granted him interim bail.

### Ongoing Judicial Custody in CBI Case

Despite the interim bail, Kejriwal's release is hindered by his detention in a separate case under the jurisdiction of the CBI. This case pertains to alleged corruption and misuse of power, with accusations that Kejriwal used his position to influence certain decisions for personal gain. The CBI arrested him following an extensive investigation that reportedly uncovered substantial evidence of wrongdoing.

### Legal Battle and Political Reactions

The legal proceedings have attracted significant media attention and sparked a wave of political reactions. AAP leaders have criticized the actions of the ED and CBI, alleging that the cases are politically motivated attempts to tarnish Kejriwal's image and destabilize the Delhi government. AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha stated, "This is a clear case of political vendetta. Arvind Kejriwal has always been a target due to his relentless fight against corruption and his unwavering stand for the people of Delhi."

On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other opposition parties have welcomed the investigations, asserting that no one is above the law. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra remarked, "The law is taking its course. If there are allegations and evidence against Kejriwal, he must face the consequences. This is about justice and accountability."

### Implications for Delhi Governance

Kejriwal's continued detention raises concerns about the governance and administrative functioning of Delhi. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has taken on the responsibilities of the Chief Minister in Kejriwal's absence, ensuring that the day-to-day operations of the government continue smoothly. However, the prolonged absence of the chief minister could potentially impact the implementation of key policies and initiatives.

### Next Steps

Kejriwal's legal team is expected to file for bail in the CBI case, seeking his release from judicial custody. The courts will scrutinize the evidence presented by the CBI before making any decision on his bail application. The legal battle is likely to be prolonged, with both sides preparing for an intense courtroom showdown.

### Conclusion

Arvind Kejriwal's ongoing legal troubles have become a focal point of national attention, highlighting the intersection of law, politics, and governance. While the Supreme Court's interim bail in the PMLA case offers some relief, the CBI case continues to cast a shadow over his immediate future. As the legal proceedings unfold, the political landscape in Delhi and beyond remains on edge, awaiting the next chapter in this high-stakes drama.
