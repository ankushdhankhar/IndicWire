**Iranians Demand Retaliation Against Israel Amid Claims of Nasrallah’s Death**

**Tehran, September 28, 2024** — Thousands of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran, raising demands for immediate retaliation against Israel in response to recent escalations in the region. The protests follow the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) intensified bombing campaign in Lebanon, particularly amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Demonstrators are particularly enraged by claims from Israel that they have killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, though these reports remain unconfirmed.

The streets of Tehran were filled with chants of "We have only one word! Revenge!" and "No compromise! No surrendering! Just battle with Israel," as citizens called for their government to take decisive military action against Israel. In a powerful visual statement, a mural in the city proclaimed, "We will retaliate from where you don't imagine!" reflecting the growing sentiment for retaliation.

The death of Nasrallah, a central figure in the Hezbollah movement, has only heightened the long-standing tensions between Iran, Hezbollah's key ally, and Israel. Hezbollah has been a vital force for Iran's influence in Lebanon and the broader region. The group’s support for Palestinian factions in Gaza has drawn them into the ongoing conflict, with Israeli strikes intensifying in both Gaza and Lebanon.

While Iranian state media has yet to confirm Nasrallah’s death, the protests in Tehran are a clear signal of the public's growing impatience and desire for a direct military response. Experts warn that if the death of Nasrallah is confirmed, it could push the region into a full-scale conflict, with Hezbollah and Iran's military forces possibly becoming more directly involved.

In the past few days, the IDF has conducted numerous strikes targeting Hezbollah positions along the Lebanese border, citing threats of cross-border attacks. Iran, a staunch supporter of Hezbollah, has condemned Israel’s actions and expressed solidarity with the Lebanese resistance.

Iranian officials have yet to respond formally to the public outcry, but the escalating situation has raised concerns about a broader regional war. Analysts believe that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard could take more overt actions in response to increasing public pressure, further complicating an already volatile situation.

As the conflict unfolds, the potential for greater regional instability looms, with both Iranian and Israeli officials closely monitoring the situation, each preparing for the possibility of further escalations.

The international community, including the United Nations, has called for restraint and dialogue, though efforts to de-escalate the situation have so far been unsuccessful. The protests in Tehran signal a growing sense of urgency among the Iranian public, with expectations that their government will act decisively against Israel in the coming days.
