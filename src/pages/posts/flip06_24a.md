**India's Opposition Slams Congress for Hypocrisy on Constitution and Democracy, Cites Emergency Era**

**Subheading:** BJP and Allies Criticize Congress Party Over Historical Emergency Declaration

**Body:**
In a heated exchange of political rhetoric, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies have accused the Indian National Congress of hypocrisy, pointing to the dark chapter of the Emergency era as evidence. The criticism comes amidst recent remarks by Congress leaders invoking constitutional values and democratic principles, prompting a revisitation of events that transpired during the Emergency declared by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.

The Emergency, a period of nearly two years from 1975 to 1977, saw a suspension of civil liberties, mass arrests of political opponents, and censorship of the press. During this time, the Congress-led government under Indira Gandhi invoked Article 352 of the Constitution, citing internal unrest and threats to national security as grounds for imposing a state of emergency. Critics argue that the move was an authoritarian clampdown aimed at consolidating power rather than addressing genuine threats.

Speaking on behalf of the ruling coalition, BJP spokesperson Rajesh Gupta stated, "It is ironic that the Congress party, which once trampled upon the very essence of democracy by imposing Emergency, now lectures the nation on constitutional values. The Emergency era remains a stark reminder of Congress's authoritarian tendencies and disregard for democratic institutions."

The BJP's criticism has been echoed by several regional parties and political commentators who point out that many current leaders of the Congress party were either directly involved or benefited from the Emergency regime. They argue that the legacy of the Emergency continues to haunt the Congress, particularly when it seeks to champion democratic norms and constitutional principles.

Responding to these accusations, Congress leaders have defended their commitment to democratic ideals while acknowledging the mistakes of the past. Senior Congress leader Anjali Sharma stated, "The Emergency was indeed a dark phase in India's history, and the Congress party has learned valuable lessons from that period. We now stand firm in our commitment to upholding the Constitution and ensuring the protection of democratic rights."

The debate over the Emergency has once again brought to the forefront the contrasting political narratives between the BJP and the Congress. While the BJP portrays itself as the defender of democracy and constitutional values, it continues to use historical events like the Emergency to question the Congress's credibility on these matters.

Political analysts believe that this exchange will further intensify as India approaches its next general elections, with both parties expected to leverage historical narratives to sway public opinion. The BJP, buoyed by its electoral successes in recent years, aims to capitalize on the electorate's concerns regarding democratic freedoms and governance.

As the political discourse evolves, the discussion on the Emergency era serves as a poignant reminder of India's tumultuous past and its implications for the future trajectory of democratic governance in the world's largest democracy.

**Conclusion:**
The political spat over the Emergency era underscores deep-seated ideological divisions between India's major political parties, with each seeking to assert its commitment to democratic principles amid renewed scrutiny of historical events.
