**India Surpasses US to Become the World's Second-Largest 5G Mobile Market: Report**

*New Delhi, September 6, 2024* — India has emerged as the world's second-largest 5G mobile market, overtaking the United States, according to the latest report from Counterpoint Research. The surge is attributed to a significant increase in 5G handset shipments, which grew by 20 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2024.

The global 5G handset market has seen robust growth, with Apple leading the charge. The tech giant accounted for more than 25 percent of global 5G handset shipments, reinforcing its dominance in the market. The report highlighted that India's rapid adoption of 5G technology and the expansion of 5G networks have been crucial factors in the country's rise to the second position, only behind China.

India's 5G market has been bolstered by aggressive rollouts of 5G services by major telecom operators, coupled with a growing demand for high-speed internet connectivity across urban and rural regions. The Indian government’s push for digitalization and the proliferation of affordable 5G-enabled smartphones have further accelerated the country's adoption of the next-generation technology.

Counterpoint Research also noted that India's success in the 5G sector could lead to more investments in digital infrastructure and innovations in related industries. As the nation continues to expand its 5G network coverage, the potential for enhanced services in sectors such as healthcare, education, and entertainment is vast.

However, the report cautioned that while India has made remarkable strides, challenges remain, particularly in terms of ensuring seamless connectivity in remote areas and maintaining affordability for consumers.

As India continues its upward trajectory in the global 5G market, the country is poised to play a critical role in shaping the future of mobile communications.
