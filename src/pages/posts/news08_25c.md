**BJP Hits Back at Rahul Gandhi Over Miss India List Remarks**

**Date:** August 25, 2024

**New Delhi:** Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have strongly condemned Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his recent comments concerning the representation of Dalits, tribals, and Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the Miss India competition. Gandhi, while speaking at a ‘Samvidhan Samman Sammelan’ event, expressed his discontent over the absence of Dalit, tribal, and OBC winners in the history of the Miss India pageant, linking it to the need for a nationwide caste census.

Gandhi's statement, which was intended to highlight systemic social exclusion, quickly drew sharp criticism from the BJP. Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for the party, labeled Gandhi's remarks as "divisive" and "full of falsehood." Bhandari argued that Gandhi was attempting to create a wedge in society by bringing caste into discussions unrelated to governance or policy. 

"The remarks made by Rahul Gandhi are not only baseless but also an attempt to stir divisions within our society," Bhandari said. "Instead of focusing on real issues, he is trying to gain political mileage by stoking caste-based sentiments."

The BJP further accused Gandhi of ignoring the progress made in promoting inclusivity and representation in various sectors, including beauty pageants. Several BJP leaders took to social media to express their discontent, accusing Gandhi of being out of touch with the realities of modern India.

BJP leaders also emphasized that the Miss India pageant, like many other platforms, is based on merit and talent, not on caste or community. They argued that Gandhi's focus on caste in this context was misguided and reflected a narrow perspective.

Gandhi, however, defended his stance, asserting that his comments were aimed at highlighting the deep-rooted inequities that still persist in Indian society. He reiterated his call for a caste census, arguing that it was essential to ensure fair representation and to address the inequalities faced by marginalized communities.

This latest exchange adds to the ongoing tension between the Congress and the BJP over issues of caste and representation, with both parties accusing each other of using these sensitive topics for political gain.
