**Congress Criticizes Union Budget 2024 as Inadequate for Economic Growth**

*New Delhi, August 12, 2024* â€” The Indian National Congress has voiced strong criticism against the Union Budget 2024, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month. The party claims the budget fails to address critical economic challenges and is unlikely to stimulate the growth needed to propel the Indian economy forward.

**Lack of Vision and Ambition**

In a press conference held at the Congress headquarters, party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh described the budget as "lacking vision and ambition." He argued that the budget falls short in addressing the needs of the common people and fails to provide a comprehensive strategy for economic recovery. According to Ramesh, the budget does not adequately tackle issues such as unemployment, inflation, and the rural distress that have been plaguing the economy.

**Key Areas of Concern**

1. **Employment and Job Creation**: The Congress party emphasized the need for a robust job creation plan, highlighting the rising unemployment rates, especially among the youth. The budget's allocation for skill development and employment generation schemes was deemed insufficient by the party. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram stated, "This budget does not inspire confidence that the government is serious about addressing the job crisis."

2. **Agricultural Sector Neglect**: The party criticized the budget for neglecting the agricultural sector, which employs a significant portion of the Indian population. Randeep Singh Surjewala, Congress leader and General Secretary, expressed disappointment over the lack of substantial measures to support farmers and increase their income. "The budget offers mere lip service to farmers without any concrete steps to alleviate their distress," he remarked.

3. **Healthcare and Education**: Congress leaders pointed out that the budgetary allocations for healthcare and education remain inadequate. They argued that the government missed an opportunity to strengthen the public healthcare system and improve educational infrastructure, which are crucial for long-term economic growth. The party urged for increased spending in these sectors to enhance accessibility and quality.

4. **Inflation and Price Rise**: The Congress criticized the budget for not providing relief to the common man from rising prices. Mallikarjun Kharge, the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, stated, "This budget does nothing to curb inflation or reduce the burden of high prices on ordinary citizens."

**Alternative Proposals**

The Congress party put forth alternative proposals, urging the government to increase public spending to boost demand and stimulate economic growth. They recommended significant investments in infrastructure projects, a comprehensive employment guarantee program, and targeted measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as means to rejuvenate the economy.

**Government's Response**

In response to the Congress's criticism, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman defended the budget, asserting that it focuses on long-term economic stability and growth. She highlighted initiatives aimed at promoting digital infrastructure, green energy, and self-reliance, stating that these measures will create sustainable growth opportunities.

**Conclusion**

As the debate over the Union Budget 2024 continues, the Congress party's critique underscores the differing visions for India's economic future. While the government emphasizes fiscal prudence and targeted reforms, the opposition calls for more aggressive spending and comprehensive policy interventions to tackle immediate economic challenges.
