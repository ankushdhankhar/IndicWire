### A Hindu temple in Canada’s Edmonton was vandalised, with hateful graffiti painted on its walls

**Edmonton, Canada** – In a shocking incident that has left the community reeling, a Hindu temple in Edmonton was vandalized with hateful graffiti, including slurs threatening Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indian-origin Canadian Member of Parliament, Chandra Arya.

**Incident Details**

The incident occurred late at night, with perpetrators defacing the temple's exterior walls with offensive graffiti. The vandals used red and black spray paint to write hate-filled messages, including threats directed at Prime Minister Modi and MP Chandra Arya. The graffiti also included anti-Hindu slogans and derogatory symbols.

**Community Reaction**

Members of the Hindu community in Edmonton are deeply disturbed and hurt by this act of vandalism. The temple, which has been a place of worship and community gathering for years, is now marked with hateful messages. Community leaders have expressed their shock and sadness over the incident.

"This is not just an attack on our temple; it's an attack on our community and our values," said Rajesh Sharma, a member of the temple's board. "We come here for peace and spirituality, and to see our sacred place defaced like this is heartbreaking."

**Political Responses**

Canadian politicians and leaders have condemned the incident. MP Chandra Arya, who was specifically targeted in the graffiti, called for a thorough investigation and stressed the importance of unity and tolerance.

"I am deeply disturbed by this hate crime targeting our Hindu temple in Edmonton," Arya said in a statement. "Such acts of hatred and bigotry have no place in our society. We must stand together to combat intolerance and ensure that all communities feel safe and respected."

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also expressed his condemnation of the vandalism. "Hate has no place in Canada," Trudeau tweeted. "We stand with the Hindu community and all those affected by this senseless act of vandalism."

**Investigation Underway**

The Edmonton Police Service has launched an investigation into the incident. Officers are reviewing surveillance footage from the area and appealing to the public for any information that could lead to the identification and apprehension of the suspects.

"We are treating this as a hate crime," said Police Chief Dale McFee. "We take such incidents very seriously and are committed to finding those responsible and bringing them to justice."

**Community Support**

In the wake of the incident, there has been an outpouring of support from various religious and community groups across Edmonton. Many have offered to help clean up the graffiti and restore the temple.

"We stand in solidarity with our Hindu brothers and sisters," said Reverend Michael Jones of the Edmonton Interfaith Centre. "An attack on one faith community is an attack on all of us. We must work together to build a more inclusive and tolerant society."

**Moving Forward**

Despite the trauma of the incident, the Hindu community in Edmonton remains resilient. Plans are already underway to repair the damage and hold a special ceremony to rededicate the temple.

"We will not let hate win," said temple president Suresh Patel. "Our faith teaches us to respond to hate with love and to remain strong in the face of adversity. We will come together as a community and continue to uphold our values of peace and unity."

**Conclusion**

The vandalism of the Hindu temple in Edmonton is a stark reminder of the challenges faced by minority communities in Canada. However, the overwhelming response of solidarity and support from the wider community highlights the strength and resilience that can overcome hate. As the investigation continues, the hope remains that justice will be served and that such incidents will spur greater efforts towards fostering an inclusive and respectful society.
