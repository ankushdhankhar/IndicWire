**Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma Leads Drug Destruction Drive on World Drug Day** 

***Takes Bold Step in the Fight Against Drug Menace***

Guwahati: In a symbolic gesture marking World Drug Day, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took charge of a road roller and led the destruction of seized illicit drugs in the state. The event, held at an undisclosed location, showcased Sarma's unwavering commitment to combatting the drug menace that has plagued Assam and other parts of the country.

In a video shared on social media platforms, Chief Minister Sarma could be seen operating the road roller himself, as tons of narcotics and psychotropic substances were crushed under its weight. This dramatic display underscored the state government's determination to tackle the issue of drug trafficking and abuse head-on.

Addressing the public through various media channels, Sarma emphasized the grave impact of drug abuse on society, particularly its detrimental effects on youth and families. He reiterated his administration's zero-tolerance policy towards drugs and outlined ongoing efforts to strengthen law enforcement, rehabilitation programs, and community initiatives aimed at prevention.

"We must collectively fight this evil that destroys lives and families," Sarma stated passionately, urging citizens to join hands with the government in creating a drug-free Assam. He highlighted the crucial role of public awareness and community involvement in eradicating the drug trade network from the roots.

The destruction drive, conducted under stringent security measures, involved the disposal of a substantial quantity of drugs seized by law enforcement agencies in recent operations across the state. This event not only symbolized the state's crackdown on illegal drug activities but also served as a stark warning to drug peddlers and suppliers.

Reacting to the event, various stakeholders including police officials, social activists, and citizens expressed support for the Chief Minister's proactive approach in addressing the escalating drug crisis. They lauded the bold step as a necessary measure towards ensuring a safer and healthier future for the people of Assam.

Chief Minister Sarma's initiative to personally lead the destruction of drugs on this occasion resonates strongly with the state's commitment to creating a drug-free environment.
