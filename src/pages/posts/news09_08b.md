**TMC MP Jawhar Sircar Pens Resignation Letter to Mamata Banerjee, Cites Disillusionment with Party**

**Kolkata, September 8, 2024** — In a significant political development, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Jawhar Sircar has announced his decision to quit politics, expressing deep disillusionment with the West Bengal state government. The former Rajya Sabha member, known for his outspoken views, penned a strongly worded letter to West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, citing corruption within the party and the mishandling of critical state issues, including the ongoing crisis at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

In the letter, Sircar expressed his growing dissatisfaction with the state of affairs within the TMC and the broader state administration. He specifically highlighted the "horror" of the situation at RG Kar Medical College, where reports of mismanagement and inadequate healthcare services have sparked widespread public outrage. Sircar criticized the government's response to the crisis, calling it inadequate and indicative of deeper systemic issues within the state's governance.

“I joined politics with the hope of contributing to the betterment of West Bengal, but I have become increasingly disillusioned with the state government’s handling of critical issues,” Sircar wrote. He further accused the TMC of being plagued by corruption, which, according to him, has eroded public trust and hindered meaningful progress in the state.

Sircar's resignation comes at a time of increasing political turbulence in West Bengal, with several leaders within the TMC voicing concerns about the party's direction. His departure is expected to add to the challenges facing Mamata Banerjee, who has been under pressure to address allegations of corruption and mismanagement within her administration.

Jawhar Sircar's exit from the political scene marks a significant blow to the TMC, as he was considered a key figure in the party's intellectual and policy circles. His decision to leave politics altogether underscores the deepening cracks within the party's ranks, potentially signaling further defections or resignations in the future.

As the news of Sircar's resignation spreads, it remains to be seen how the TMC leadership will respond and whether this move will trigger a broader introspection within the party. The RG Kar Medical College crisis, now under the national spotlight, could become a focal point of opposition criticism as the state government grapples with the fallout from Sircar's departure.
