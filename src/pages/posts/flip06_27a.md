### Padma Shri Awardee Darshanam Mogulaiah Faces Financial Struggles, Forced to Work as Construction Worker

**Hyderabad, India - June 27, 2024:**

In a tragic twist of fate, Darshanam Mogulaiah, the distinguished artist and 2022 Padma Shri awardee, is facing severe financial hardships, forcing him to take up a job as a construction worker. Despite his remarkable contributions to preserving the traditional Kinnera art form, Mogulaiah's current plight highlights the harsh realities faced by many artists in India.

#### From Celebrated Artist to Construction Worker

Mogulaiah, renowned for his mastery of the Kinnera, an ancient musical instrument integral to the cultural heritage of Telangana, has found himself struggling to make ends meet. Despite receiving one of India's highest civilian honors, the Padma Shri, in recognition of his artistic excellence, Mogulaiah's financial situation has deteriorated to the point where he cannot afford basic necessities such as food and rent.

In a bid to survive, Mogulaiah has taken up work as a construction laborer in Hyderabad, earning a meager Rs. 7,000 per month. This income is insufficient to cover his living expenses, leaving him in a precarious position. The stark contrast between his celebrated status and his current struggles underscores a broader issue faced by many traditional artists who lack adequate financial support.

#### The High Cost of Cultural Preservation

Mogulaiah's situation sheds light on the often-overlooked financial difficulties encountered by artists dedicated to preserving traditional art forms. While awards and recognition bring prestige, they do not necessarily translate into financial stability. For Mogulaiah, the costs associated with maintaining his craft and personal expenses have proven overwhelming, leading to his current predicament.

The Kinnera, with its intricate construction and historical significance, requires considerable time and resources to create and master. Mogulaiah's dedication to this art form has not waned, but the lack of financial support has made it increasingly difficult for him to sustain his livelihood through his art alone.

#### Calls for Support

The news of Mogulaiah's financial struggles has sparked outrage and concern among cultural enthusiasts and fellow artists. Many are calling for increased support for traditional artists, emphasizing the need for sustainable financial assistance to ensure that cultural heritage is preserved without the artists facing destitution.

Organizations and individuals are urged to step forward and provide assistance to Mogulaiah and others in similar situations. There is a growing demand for the government and cultural institutions to establish more robust support systems, including grants, sponsorships, and pension schemes, to safeguard the well-being of artists who play a crucial role in preserving India's rich cultural tapestry.

#### A Plea for Help

In his own words, Mogulaiah expressed his gratitude for the recognition he has received but also voiced his deep concerns about his financial future. "I am honored to have received the Padma Shri, but it has not changed my daily reality. I still struggle to provide for my family and continue my work as an artist. I hope that more can be done to support artists like me, so we can focus on our craft without constant worry about survival."

### Conclusion

The story of Darshanam Mogulaiah is a poignant reminder of the need to bridge the gap between recognition and support for traditional artists in India. As a nation that prides itself on its rich cultural heritage, it is imperative to ensure that the custodians of this heritage are not left to struggle in obscurity and poverty. Mogulaiah's plight calls for urgent action to provide sustainable support for artists, ensuring that they can continue to enrich India's cultural landscape without facing financial ruin.
