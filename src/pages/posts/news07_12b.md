### Controversy Over Kirti Chakra and Memorabilia of Late Captain Anshuman Singh

**Srinagar, July 12, 2024** – A dispute has arisen within the family of the late Captain Anshuman Singh, who was awarded the Kirti Chakra posthumously following his death during a fire incident in Siachen in July last year. The family claims that his widow, Smriti Singh, has taken the prestigious award along with other personal memorabilia to her home in Gurdaspur, Punjab, without their consent.

Captain Anshuman Singh's parents, Ravi Pratap Singh and his wife, have expressed their deep distress over the matter. According to Ravi Pratap Singh, his daughter-in-law removed the Kirti Chakra, Captain Anshuman's photo albums, clothes, and other cherished items from their home. “The criteria set to Next of Kin (NOK) is not correct. I have also spoken to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh about this. Anshuman’s wife doesn’t live with us now,” he said, highlighting the emotional toll this incident has taken on them.

### Family's Plea for Recognition and Justice

The Singh family has argued that the current criteria for recognizing the next of kin (NOK) by the military do not consider the complexities of family dynamics. Ravi Pratap Singh stated, "We were very close to our son, and his memories mean a great deal to us. The current system does not take into account the relationships we shared with him."

The grieving parents have reached out to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, seeking his intervention in the matter. They hope for a resolution that acknowledges their emotional and sentimental ties to Captain Anshuman, beyond the formal NOK designation. “We need a system that is more humane and understands the depth of our loss,” Ravi Pratap Singh added.

### Background: The Tragic Incident

Captain Anshuman Singh lost his life in a tragic fire incident at the Siachen Glacier, the world's highest battlefield, in July 2023. His bravery and sacrifice were recognized by the government with the posthumous award of the Kirti Chakra, India's second-highest peacetime gallantry award. The award was meant to honor his memory and valor, serving as a lasting tribute to his service and dedication.

### The Controversy Over Personal Belongings

The controversy began when Smriti Singh, Anshuman's widow, moved out of her in-laws' residence in Srinagar to her parental home in Gurdaspur. According to Ravi Pratap Singh, she took the Kirti Chakra along with other personal items, which the family feels should have remained with them as a remembrance of their son.

Smriti Singh has not yet responded to the allegations publicly, and her side of the story remains unclear. The Singh family, meanwhile, has been vocal about their grievances, seeking support from the community and the government.

### Call for Revised NOK Criteria

This incident has sparked a broader conversation about the criteria used to determine the next of kin for military personnel. Many families in similar situations have come forward, sharing their stories of emotional hardship and the need for a more inclusive approach.

The Singh family hopes that their case will lead to a reevaluation of the policies governing the designation of NOK, ensuring that all family members who shared a close bond with the deceased are considered in decisions regarding personal memorabilia and honors.

### Conclusion

As the Singh family awaits a response from the Defence Ministry, their plea underscores the importance of compassion and understanding in the wake of tragedy. Captain Anshuman Singh's legacy of bravery and sacrifice deserves to be honored in a manner that respects the emotional bonds and memories of all those who loved him. 

The Defence Ministry has yet to issue a statement regarding the family's appeal, but the case has certainly highlighted the need for a more nuanced approach to NOK recognition in the armed forces.
