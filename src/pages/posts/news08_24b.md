**France Opens Terror Probe After Blast Near Synagogue**

*Paris, France* â€“ Authorities have launched a terror probe following a blast outside a synagogue in the city, which has raised concerns over potential targeted attacks. The incident occurred, when two cars parked outside a synagogue burst into flames, causing significant alarm among the local community.

According to police, the fire appears to have been triggered by the explosion of a gas canister inside one of the vehicles. The blast resulted in the complete destruction of both cars, though fortunately, no injuries have been reported. 

A source close to the investigation revealed that CCTV footage from the area captured a potential suspect shortly before the explosion. The individual was seen brandishing a Palestinian flag, an action that has heightened suspicions about the motives behind the incident. While authorities have not yet confirmed a direct link between the suspect and the blast, the display of the flag is being considered as a possible indicator of a politically or ideologically motivated attack.

The French government has expressed deep concern over the incident, particularly given the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in recent years. Interior Minister [Name] stated, "We are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness and are committed to ensuring the safety and security of all our citizens. Any act of violence or terrorism, especially targeting religious communities, will be met with the full force of the law."

The synagogue, which was unoccupied at the time of the explosion, has been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure. Local authorities have increased security in the area, and additional police patrols have been deployed to safeguard other religious sites across the city.

Investigators are currently working to identify the suspect and ascertain whether the explosion was part of a broader plot. The incident has sparked concerns within the Jewish community, with leaders urging vigilance and calling for heightened security measures.

As the probe continues, authorities are appealing to the public for any information that could assist in the investigation. The incident has also reignited discussions on the need for stronger counter-terrorism efforts in the country.

The investigation is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.
