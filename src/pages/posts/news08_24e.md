**NRI Shot at in Front of Family in Amritsar, Assailants Flee as Gun Jams**

*Amritsar, Punjab – August 24, 2024:* A Non-Resident Indian (NRI) was shot at by armed assailants in a shocking attack at his residence in Amritsar on the evening of August 23. The victim, identified as Sukhchain Singh, narrowly escaped with his life after the gun wielded by one of the attackers jammed during the assault. The terrifying incident unfolded in the presence of Singh's wife and young son, who were left traumatized by the ordeal.

### **The Incident**

According to police reports, the attack took place at approximately 7:30 PM when two armed men forcibly entered Sukhchain Singh's home in the Ranjit Avenue area of Amritsar. The assailants, whose identities remain unknown, were reportedly wearing masks to conceal their faces. They confronted Singh in his living room, where his wife and son were also present.

Eyewitnesses recount that the attackers demanded money and other valuables from Singh. Despite the family's desperate pleas for mercy, one of the men fired at Singh from close range. Miraculously, the first shot missed its mark. As the gunman attempted to fire again, the weapon jammed, giving Singh a brief window of opportunity to flee to a safer location within the house.

Realizing that their plan had been foiled, the assailants panicked and fled the scene on foot, leaving behind a shocked and terrified family. The entire incident lasted only a few minutes but has left deep psychological scars on Singh's wife and son.

### **Investigation Underway**

Punjab Police have launched a full-scale investigation into the attack. Forensic teams have already begun collecting evidence from the crime scene, including the faulty firearm left behind by the assailants. Authorities believe that the attack may have been premeditated and are exploring various motives, including personal enmity or an extortion attempt.

Preliminary findings suggest that the attackers were familiar with Singh’s routine and may have been watching his movements for some time before executing the attack. The police are also examining CCTV footage from the surrounding area to identify the attackers and track their movements.

Speaking to the media, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Naresh Kumar stated, "This was a cowardly attack on an innocent man in front of his family. We are leaving no stone unturned to apprehend the culprits. We are confident that the evidence collected will lead to their swift capture."

### **Community Reaction**

The incident has sent shockwaves through the local NRI community in Amritsar, many of whom are now expressing concerns about their safety. Several community leaders have called for increased security measures, especially in areas with a significant NRI population.

Gurpreet Singh, a prominent NRI community leader, said, "This incident highlights the growing threat to the safety of NRIs who return to Punjab. We urge the authorities to take immediate action to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future."

### **Family’s Condition**

Sukhchain Singh, who sustained minor injuries during the attack, was treated at a local hospital and later discharged. However, his wife and son are reportedly in a state of shock and are receiving counseling to help them cope with the traumatic experience.

### **Conclusion**

As the investigation continues, the police have appealed to the public for any information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects. The incident has raised serious questions about the security situation in Punjab, especially for NRIs who return to their homeland. The authorities have assured the public that they are committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice and restoring a sense of safety in the community.
