**Supreme Court of India Fast-Tracks Process for Release of Undertrials Under New Criminal Laws**

*New Delhi, August 23, 2024* – The Supreme Court of India has taken a significant step towards ensuring swift justice by fast-tracking the process for the release of undertrials in line with the newly enacted criminal laws. In a landmark directive issued on Thursday, the apex court has mandated all lower courts to prioritize the review of cases involving undertrials who have been incarcerated for prolonged periods, especially those whose detention exceeds half the maximum sentence for the alleged offense.

### **Context and Background**

The move comes in the wake of the recently introduced criminal law reforms aimed at overhauling the justice delivery system in India. These reforms, which include amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and the Indian Evidence Act, are designed to address the issues of delay, backlog, and inefficiency that have plagued the judicial process for decades.

One of the key provisions in the new laws is the emphasis on reducing the number of undertrials languishing in jails. Undertrials are individuals who have been accused of a crime and are awaiting trial but have not yet been convicted. India’s prisons have long been overcrowded, with undertrials making up nearly 70% of the total prison population, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

### **Supreme Court's Directive**

Chief Justice of India (CJI), Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who presided over the bench hearing the matter, expressed concern over the inordinate delays in trial proceedings and the human rights implications of prolonged detention without conviction. The bench has directed all High Courts to issue necessary guidelines to subordinate courts for expediting the review of undertrial cases.

Justice Chandrachud emphasized that the new criminal laws must be implemented with immediate effect to provide relief to those who have been denied their right to a speedy trial. The Supreme Court has also instructed the legal aid authorities to assist undertrials in filing necessary applications for bail or release under the revised legal framework.

### **Impact on Undertrials**

The Supreme Court's decision is expected to have a profound impact on the justice system, particularly in alleviating the burden on prisons and providing timely justice to those awaiting trial. Legal experts have hailed the move as a much-needed intervention, arguing that it will help restore public faith in the criminal justice system.

Advocate Aparna Bhat, a noted human rights lawyer, stated, "This is a historic move by the Supreme Court. The plight of undertrials has been a dark spot on our justice system for far too long. By fast-tracking their release, the court is sending a strong message that the rights of the accused must be respected, and justice should not be delayed."

### **Challenges Ahead**

Despite the positive response, challenges remain in the effective implementation of the Supreme Court's directive. The judiciary will need to address the existing backlog of cases and ensure that lower courts are equipped to handle the influx of review petitions. Additionally, the coordination between various state legal services authorities, prison authorities, and the judiciary will be crucial to the success of this initiative.

Furthermore, there is concern that without adequate monitoring, some cases may slip through the cracks, leaving undertrials without the relief intended by the new laws. To mitigate this, the Supreme Court has proposed the establishment of a monitoring committee at the district level to oversee the review process and ensure that the directives are being followed diligently.

### **Conclusion**

The Supreme Court’s decision to fast-track the release of undertrials under the new criminal laws marks a significant milestone in India’s journey towards a more efficient and humane justice system. While challenges persist, the directive is a step in the right direction, promising a future where justice is not only served but served promptly.

As the legal community and civil society organizations mobilize to support this initiative, the onus is now on the lower judiciary and the executive to work together in ensuring that the rights of undertrials are upheld and that the promise of justice is fulfilled for all.
