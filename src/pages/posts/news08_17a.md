**Sabarmati Express Derailed Due to Object on Track: Railway Minister Questions Intent Behind Malicious Act**

**Date: August 17, 2024**

**Location: New Delhi**

In a disturbing incident that has raised concerns about the safety of the Indian Railways, the Sabarmati Express derailed today near Dahod in Gujarat after an unknown object was deliberately placed on the railway track. The derailment, which occurred in the early hours of the morning, caused significant damage to the train, but fortunately, no casualties have been reported. However, several passengers sustained minor injuries and were promptly taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Union Minister for Railways, expressed deep concern over the incident, labeling it as a "deliberate act of sabotage." He emphasized that the derailment could have led to a much graver tragedy, endangering the lives of hundreds of passengers. The Minister visited the site of the incident and assured the public that a thorough investigation is underway to identify and apprehend those responsible for this heinous act.

"The safety and security of passengers is our utmost priority. Placing objects on railway tracks is not just a criminal act but an attack on the dignity and integrity of our nation," Vaishnaw stated. He questioned the motive behind such an act, asking what kind of mindset would compel individuals to endanger the lives of innocent people.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) and local police have been mobilized to conduct an extensive search operation in the area. They are examining CCTV footage and interviewing witnesses to gather information about the perpetrators. Preliminary reports suggest that the object placed on the track was large enough to cause the derailment, and its placement appears to have been a calculated move to inflict maximum damage.

Local residents, who rushed to the scene to assist in rescue efforts, expressed their shock and disbelief at the incident. "Whoever did this has no respect for human life. It is a disgraceful act that could have had devastating consequences," said one of the locals who helped evacuate passengers from the derailed coaches.

Vaishnaw has appealed to the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity near railway tracks to the authorities. He also assured that the Railways will take stringent action against those found guilty, ensuring that they are held accountable for their actions.

The incident has sparked a broader debate on the need for increased security measures along railway tracks, especially in vulnerable areas. The Railway Ministry is expected to announce additional safety protocols in the coming days to prevent such incidents in the future.

As the investigation continues, questions remain about the intentions and identity of those who committed this act. The derailment of the Sabarmati Express serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by malicious acts and the importance of collective responsibility in ensuring the safety of public infrastructure.
