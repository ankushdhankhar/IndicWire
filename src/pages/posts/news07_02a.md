### Gross GST Collection Increases by 8% to ₹ 1.74 Lakh Crore in June

**New Delhi, July 2, 2024:** The gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection for the month of June has surged by 8 percent, reaching ₹ 1.74 lakh crore, according to sources. This increase reflects a robust performance in tax revenue amidst economic recovery efforts.

The rise in GST collections signals a positive trend for the Indian economy, indicating increased consumer spending and business activity. This upward movement in tax revenues is crucial for the government as it seeks to manage fiscal deficits and fund public expenditure.

Despite the encouraging figures, the government has decided to discontinue the official release of monthly GST collection data, sources revealed. The rationale behind this decision has not been officially stated, but it marks a significant change in the dissemination of fiscal information to the public and stakeholders.

The last official GST data released showed a collection of ₹ 1.61 lakh crore in May, reflecting a consistent upward trend in the revenue figures over recent months. This latest increase to ₹ 1.74 lakh crore underscores the resilience of the economy and the effectiveness of the GST system in capturing tax revenue from a wide range of goods and services.

Economists and industry experts are likely to analyze this data closely to understand the underlying economic activities contributing to the rise. It is expected that sectors such as manufacturing, services, and retail have played a significant role in driving the higher GST collections.

As the government moves forward without the regular monthly updates on GST collections, businesses, analysts, and policymakers will need to rely on alternative sources and methods to gauge economic health and fiscal performance. This development could also lead to calls for greater transparency and continued access to detailed economic data.

In the backdrop of this financial development, stakeholders will be keenly watching the upcoming fiscal policies and economic measures the government will adopt to sustain and build upon this growth in GST collections.
