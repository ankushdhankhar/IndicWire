**Rahul Gandhi Accuses Government of Copying Congress Manifesto in 2024 Budget**

**Date: August 12, 2024**

**Location: New Delhi, India**

In a sharp critique of the recently unveiled Union Budget 2024, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of plagiarizing the Congress party's election manifesto. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Gandhi claimed that several key proposals outlined in the budget were direct lifts from the Congress manifesto, which was released ahead of the upcoming general elections.

### Key Allegations

Gandhi pointed to several initiatives announced in the budget that he asserted were originally proposed by the Congress party:

1. **Universal Basic Income**: The budget's introduction of a basic income scheme for the poorest households was highlighted by Gandhi as a significant element of the Congress manifesto. He emphasized that the Congress party had long advocated for a universal basic income to alleviate poverty and support the economically disadvantaged.

2. **Healthcare Reforms**: The budget's allocation for healthcare reforms, particularly the expansion of public healthcare infrastructure and free medical services for certain sections of the population, was claimed by Gandhi to mirror Congress's healthcare proposals.

3. **Agricultural Support**: Gandhi noted that the government's commitment to doubling farmers' income and increasing support prices for key crops closely resembled the Congress party's promises to revitalize the agricultural sector.

4. **Education Initiatives**: The budget's focus on enhancing educational infrastructure and increasing scholarships for underprivileged students was also alleged to have been borrowed from Congress's vision for education reform.

### Political Reactions

The accusations have sparked a political storm, with Congress leaders rallying behind Gandhi's claims. Senior Congress spokespersons have demanded an explanation from the government and called for transparency in the budgetary process. They argue that the ruling party's decision to incorporate Congress's ideas is an acknowledgment of the opposition party's forward-thinking policies.

### Government's Response

In response, the BJP has dismissed Gandhi's allegations as baseless and politically motivated. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while defending the budget, stated that the government's proposals were the result of extensive consultations and aimed at addressing the needs of the nation. She accused the Congress party of attempting to undermine the government's achievements and create unnecessary controversies ahead of the elections.

### Public Perception

The public reaction to the controversy has been mixed. While some citizens and commentators view the similarities in the budget and Congress manifesto as a positive indication of bipartisan recognition of key issues, others see it as a political tactic by both parties to claim credit for popular policies.

### Conclusion

As the debate continues to unfold, the accusations have added another layer of complexity to the political landscape in India. With general elections on the horizon, the Congress party's claims and the government's rebuttal are likely to play a significant role in shaping voter perceptions and influencing the electoral narrative. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining how this controversy impacts the strategies and fortunes of both major political parties in India.
