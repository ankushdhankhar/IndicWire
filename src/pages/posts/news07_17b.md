**Suvendu Adhikari Advocates New Slogan for BJP: 'Jo Hamare Saath, Hum Unke Saath'**

*Kolkata, 17 July 2024* — In a significant departure from the BJP’s long-standing slogan of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,' Suvendu Adhikari, a prominent BJP leader in West Bengal, has proposed a new slogan: 'Jo Hamare Saath, Hum Unke Saath.' This move is seen as an attempt to realign the party’s strategy and messaging in the state.

### A Shift in Strategy

Speaking at a rally in Kolkata, Adhikari emphasized the need for the BJP to focus more on loyalty and mutual support. "We must prioritize those who stand with us through thick and thin. Our new slogan reflects this principle: 'Jo Hamare Saath, Hum Unke Saath' (We stand with those who stand with us)," he declared, receiving applause from the crowd.

Adhikari's proposal comes in the wake of growing tensions within the BJP’s state unit, with some members expressing dissatisfaction over the central leadership’s handling of local issues. By advocating for a more localized and loyalty-based approach, Adhikari aims to consolidate the party’s base and strengthen its grassroots connections.

### Reaction within the Party

The new slogan has sparked a debate within the BJP. While some leaders support Adhikari's stance, arguing that it reflects the ground realities of West Bengal politics, others caution against moving away from the inclusive development agenda encapsulated in 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.'

A senior BJP leader, who wished to remain anonymous, commented, "While it is important to acknowledge and support our loyalists, we must not lose sight of our broader mission of inclusive development and growth. Adhikari's slogan needs to be balanced with our party's core values."

### Political Implications

Adhikari’s new slogan is seen as a strategic move to counter the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its leader, Mamata Banerjee. By emphasizing loyalty and support, Adhikari hopes to rally the BJP’s core supporters and attract disenchanted TMC members who feel neglected by their party.

Political analysts suggest that this shift could help the BJP make inroads in constituencies where the party has struggled to gain a foothold. "Adhikari's slogan is a clear message to voters and party workers alike: loyalty will be rewarded. This could galvanize the BJP’s base and attract new supporters," said Dr. Anupam Mukherjee, a political analyst based in Kolkata.

### Challenges Ahead

However, the success of this new slogan will depend on its acceptance within the party and among the electorate. The BJP will need to navigate internal divisions and ensure that the new message does not alienate broader segments of the population.

Adhikari, known for his grassroots connect and strong political acumen, is confident that this new approach will resonate with the people of West Bengal. "Our focus is clear: we will stand by those who stand by us. This is not just a slogan; it is a commitment," he stated at the rally.

### Conclusion

As the BJP gears up for the upcoming elections in West Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari's new slogan 'Jo Hamare Saath, Hum Unke Saath' marks a significant shift in the party’s strategy. Whether this new approach will help the BJP consolidate its position in the state remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly adds a new dimension to the political discourse in West Bengal.
