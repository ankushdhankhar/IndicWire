**Abu Azmi's Remarks on Bala Saheb Spark Outrage; Shiv Sainiks Retaliate with Violence**

*Mumbai, July 21, 2024* â€“ In a recent development that has stirred the political landscape of Maharashtra, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi's controversial remarks about the late Shiv Sena founder Bala Saheb Thackeray have led to a violent backlash from Shiv Sena supporters.

### The Incident

During a public address on July 19, Abu Azmi referred to Bala Saheb Thackeray as "old and senile," a comment that was met with immediate outrage from Shiv Sena members and supporters. Azmi's remarks were widely condemned as disrespectful and inflammatory, considering Bala Saheb's revered status among Shiv Sainiks and his significant influence on Maharashtra's political and cultural fabric.

### Immediate Reaction

The Shiv Sena, known for its fierce loyalty to its founder, responded with anger and indignation. Party spokespersons issued statements denouncing Azmi's comments, calling them an affront to the legacy of a leader who played a pivotal role in shaping the state's political discourse.

### Violent Retaliation

On July 20, tensions escalated as groups of Shiv Sainiks took to the streets, targeting Azmi's properties and party offices. Reports indicate that Azmi's residence in Mumbai and several Samajwadi Party offices were vandalized. Protesters were seen shouting slogans and burning effigies of Azmi, demanding a public apology and retraction of his statements.

Eyewitnesses reported that the mob used stones and sticks to inflict damage, with several incidents of arson being recorded. Police forces were deployed to control the situation, leading to several arrests and injuries on both sides.

### Political Fallout

The incident has drawn widespread attention, with leaders from various political parties weighing in. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde condemned both Azmi's comments and the violent retaliation by Shiv Sena supporters. "While we uphold the right to free speech, resorting to violence is not the answer. We urge all parties to maintain peace and address their grievances through dialogue," Shinde stated.

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav also criticized the violence, calling for immediate action against the perpetrators. "Our democracy allows for differences in opinion, but violence is never justified. We stand by Abu Azmi and will pursue legal action to ensure justice," Yadav said.

### Legal Actions and Investigations

The Mumbai Police have launched an investigation into the attacks, with several Shiv Sainiks being detained for questioning. Authorities have also provided additional security to Abu Azmi and his family in light of the threats.

In response to the situation, Abu Azmi issued a statement expressing regret for any offense caused but did not retract his comments. He emphasized the importance of free speech and called for an end to the violence.

### Conclusion

As tensions continue to simmer, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the deeply entrenched political rivalries in Maharashtra. The clash between the Samajwadi Party and Shiv Sena underscores the volatile nature of political discourse in the state, highlighting the need for greater restraint and dialogue among leaders to prevent such incidents from escalating into violence.
