### LJP Joins JDU and RLD in Opposing Uttar Pradesh Government's Advisory for Eateries along 'Kanwar Yatra' Route

**Lucknow, July 20, 2024** â€“ The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), a key ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has joined hands with the Janata Dal (United) (JDU) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in opposing the Uttar Pradesh government's recent advisory for eateries along the 'Kanwar Yatra' route. The advisory, which has stirred significant political and social discourse, has been criticized for promoting division based on caste and religion.

The 'Kanwar Yatra' is an annual pilgrimage during which devotees of Lord Shiva, known as Kanwariyas, travel to collect holy water from the Ganges River and offer it at Shiva temples. The Uttar Pradesh government issued an advisory to eateries along the route, suggesting they cater to the specific dietary preferences of the Kanwariyas. Critics argue that this advisory implicitly promotes religious segregation and could foster communal tensions.

**Chirag Paswan's Stand**

Union Minister Chirag Paswan, leader of the LJP, has vocally opposed the advisory, emphasizing the need for unity among all communities. In a public statement, Paswan underscored the importance of harmony and inclusivity in Indian society.

"We must reject any form of division based on caste or religion," Paswan said. "The advisory issued by the Uttar Pradesh government is not in line with our nation's values of unity and diversity. Our focus should be on bringing communities together, not dividing them."

Paswan's stance is particularly notable given the LJP's alliance with the BJP, which leads the Uttar Pradesh government. His criticism reflects a growing concern among political allies and opposition parties about policies that could potentially undermine social cohesion.

**JDU and RLD's Position**

The Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal have also expressed strong opposition to the advisory. JDU leaders have called for its immediate withdrawal, arguing that it is discriminatory and counterproductive. RLD spokespersons have echoed these sentiments, highlighting the need for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for all communities.

**Broader Political Implications**

The opposition from LJP, JDU, and RLD adds to the mounting pressure on the Uttar Pradesh government to reconsider its advisory. This alliance of political forces across party lines signifies a united front against policies perceived as divisive. It also reflects broader concerns about the potential for such advisories to exacerbate communal tensions.

The BJP, on the other hand, has defended the advisory, stating that it aims to ensure the comfort and convenience of the Kanwariyas during their pilgrimage. Party representatives have argued that the advisory is a practical measure and should not be interpreted as promoting segregation.

**Public Response**

The public response to the advisory has been mixed. While some support the government's effort to accommodate the Kanwariyas' needs, others share the concerns raised by LJP, JDU, and RLD. Social media platforms have been abuzz with debates, highlighting the contentious nature of the advisory.

### Conclusion

As the political debate continues, the Uttar Pradesh government faces a critical decision on whether to uphold or withdraw the advisory. The call for unity and inclusivity from influential political figures like Chirag Paswan underscores the delicate balance between catering to specific community needs and ensuring policies that promote social harmony. The coming days will be crucial in determining the outcome of this controversy and its impact on the political landscape in Uttar Pradesh and beyond.
