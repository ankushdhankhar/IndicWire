The police have detained one individual, Sanjoy Roy, after reviewing hospital CCTV footage. The investigation is ongoing as authorities attempt to piece together the events leading to the victim's death. The victim, who was in charge of patients in the chest medicine ward, was last seen at the end of her night shift at 2 am. She then proceeded to a third-floor seminar room to rest and study.

Her absence was noted the following morning when colleagues attempted to contact her by phone, which went unanswered. The grim discovery of her body was made by an intern, who stumbled upon the scene.

Eyewitnesses described the scene as distressing, with the doctor's body partially covered by a bedsheet and her personal belongings scattered around her. Initial reports suggest signs of a struggle and severe physical assault.

**Authorities Respond**

Kolkata’s Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal, along with additional police personnel, inspected the site, and forensic teams conducted preliminary examinations. The findings indicate violent resistance and possible sexual assault, as suggested by injuries found on her body.

In response to the tragedy, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has communicated directly with the victim's family, offering her condolences and assuring them of her commitment to seeking justice. The hospital has established an 11-member committee to investigate the incident, while the police have formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to focus on the homicide investigation.

**National Outcry and Demands for Justice**

The case has captured national attention, with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) condemning the incident and demanding swift action. The IMA has threatened to initiate nationwide protests unless there is prompt progress in the investigation.

The victim’s family, along with colleagues and fellow students, are calling for transparency and accountability as they mourn the loss of a promising young doctor. The incident has sparked a larger conversation about the safety of medical professionals and the urgent need for improved security measures in healthcare facilities.

As the investigation continues, there is a collective demand for justice and assurance that such a tragedy will not occur again. The medical community and the nation await the outcome of the investigation with the hope that those responsible will be held accountable.
