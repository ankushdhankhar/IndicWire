**Pakistani Defence Minister Comments on Article 370 Restoration, Says "On the Same Page" with Congress Alliance**

*Islamabad, September 19, 2024* – Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif sparked fresh debate with his recent comments regarding the potential restoration of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, aligning with India's Congress party and its alliance partner, the National Conference (NC). Speaking at a press conference, Asif hinted at the possibility of Congress-led opposition parties playing a pivotal role in the region’s future political landscape.

### **Article 370 and the Congress-NC Alliance**
Article 370, which granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated by the Indian government in August 2019 under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The move was hailed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a step towards national integration, but it faced staunch opposition from various political parties, including Congress and the National Conference.

Asif’s remarks come at a critical time when the political alliance between Congress and NC has gained momentum. "There is a high chance that the Congress-National Conference alliance will come to power in Jammu and Kashmir," he said. "Pakistan is on the same page with this alliance regarding Article 370 and believes in the peaceful resolution of this issue."

### **Restoration Hopes and Political Context**
While Congress and NC have been vocal about their demand to restore Article 370, it remains unclear if the alliance would be able to garner enough political support to overturn the BJP’s decision. For Pakistan, the abrogation of Article 370 has been a contentious issue, straining bilateral relations with India and leading to Pakistan’s continued advocacy for the self-determination of Kashmiris.

### **Implications for Bilateral Relations**
Asif’s comments signal a potential softening of Pakistan’s stance towards certain Indian political factions, specifically the Congress-NC alliance, which has called for restoring the erstwhile special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan’s alignment with the Congress-NC bloc could lead to diplomatic complexities, especially as India continues to assert that the abrogation is an internal matter.

The Pakistani Defence Minister's statements also reflect Islamabad’s strategy of engaging with different political forces within India to support its long-standing position on Kashmir. However, the likelihood of Article 370 being restored remains uncertain as the BJP, which currently holds a significant majority in the Indian Parliament, strongly opposes any reversal of the 2019 decision.

### **Responses and Reactions**
Political reactions to Asif’s remarks have been mixed. Indian ruling party officials have sharply criticized the statement, interpreting it as an attempt by Pakistan to meddle in India’s internal affairs. A senior BJP leader responded, "Pakistan should focus on addressing its own domestic challenges rather than commenting on India’s sovereign matters."

On the other hand, the Congress party has maintained a cautious silence regarding Asif's comments, while National Conference leader Omar Abdullah reiterated that his party would continue to work for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s autonomy.

As both nations navigate this delicate geopolitical issue, Khawaja Asif's statement may be seen as a signal of Pakistan's willingness to support political forces within India that are sympathetic to its stance on Kashmir.
