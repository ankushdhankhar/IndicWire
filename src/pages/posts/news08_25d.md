### **Two Sisters Found Dead with Throats Slit in Bengaluru; Stepfather Named as Primary Suspect**

**Bengaluru, August 25, 2024** – In a chilling incident that has sent shockwaves through Bengaluru, two teenage sisters were found dead with their throats slit in their home in the city’s North East region. The police have identified the primary suspect as their stepfather, Mohan, who is currently on the run.

#### **The Crime**

The tragic event came to light when the mother of the victims, Anita, returned home after running errands on the morning of August 25th. Upon entering the house, she found her daughters lying in pools of blood in their bedroom. Both girls, aged 14 and 16, had their throats brutally slit. The horrific scene immediately prompted Anita to alert the police.

#### **Primary Suspect**

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) North East, Sajeeth VJ, confirmed that Mohan, the stepfather of the deceased girls, is the primary suspect in the case. “CCTV footage from the surrounding area clearly shows Mohan as the only person entering and leaving the house during the timeframe in which the murders occurred,” stated DCP Sajeeth. The footage provides crucial evidence, making Mohan the prime suspect in this gruesome crime.

#### **Motive Behind the Murder**

According to initial reports, the motive behind the murders appears to be rooted in Mohan’s extreme opposition to the girls interacting with boys. Anita, the girls' mother, revealed that Mohan had been increasingly controlling and aggressive, particularly when it came to the girls’ social interactions. He allegedly did not even allow them to sit next to boys in school, fearing that they might engage in inappropriate relationships.

“Mohan was very strict with the girls. He didn’t want them to have any kind of interaction with boys, even if it was innocent. He believed they should not speak to or sit next to boys, and this caused frequent arguments in the family,” said Anita in a statement to the police.

#### **Manhunt Underway**

Following the discovery of the crime, the police launched an intensive manhunt for Mohan, who is believed to have fled the city. Special teams have been formed to trace his whereabouts, and all exit points from the city are being closely monitored. The police have also issued an alert to neighboring states to prevent his escape.

“We are leaving no stone unturned in our search for the suspect. We have circulated his photograph and details to all police stations across the state and neighboring regions. We urge the public to come forward with any information that could lead to his arrest,” said DCP Sajeeth.

#### **Community in Shock**

The brutal murders have left the local community in shock. Neighbors described the girls as bright and well-behaved, expressing disbelief that such a heinous act could have occurred within their neighborhood. Many have gathered outside the family’s home, offering support to Anita, who is reportedly in a state of deep shock and grief.

“This is a tragedy beyond words. The girls were so young, and to think that they lost their lives in such a brutal manner is heart-wrenching,” said a neighbor who wished to remain anonymous.

#### **Police Appeal for Information**

The Bengaluru Police have appealed to the public for any information that could assist in the swift apprehension of Mohan. They have also requested that anyone with knowledge of the suspect’s whereabouts come forward immediately.

As investigations continue, the tragic deaths of the two young sisters have reignited conversations about domestic violence and the need for stronger interventions in cases of family discord. The police have assured the public that they are working tirelessly to bring the perpetrator to justice and ensure that such a horrific crime does not go unpunished.
