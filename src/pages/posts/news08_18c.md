**123 Countries Joined Voice of Global South Summit; China and Pakistan Not Invited**

**Date:** August 18, 2024

**Location:** New Delhi, India

In a significant move to amplify the concerns and aspirations of developing nations, 123 countries participated in the "Voice of Global South Summit," hosted by India. The summit, which aimed to foster unity and collaboration among developing countries, concluded with key discussions on tackling shared challenges such as climate change, debt distress, food and energy security, and the need for reforming global governance institutions.

### **Summit Overview**

The summit brought together leaders, diplomats, and representatives from across the Global South, a term that collectively refers to developing nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The event underscored India's commitment to acting as a bridge between the developed and developing worlds, particularly in the context of global issues that disproportionately affect poorer nations.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, in a media briefing following the conclusion of the summit, highlighted the importance of the event, stating, "The Voice of Global South Summit is a platform where the developing world can come together, speak in unison, and ensure that our voices are heard on the global stage. This is not just about sharing concerns but about charting a course for the future that reflects our collective aspirations."

### **China and Pakistan Not Invited**

In a notable decision, China and Pakistan were not invited to the summit. While the official reasons for their exclusion were not explicitly stated, analysts believe this move reflects India's complex relationships with both countries. China, despite being a major player on the global stage, has often been seen as pursuing its own geopolitical and economic interests, which sometimes conflict with those of other developing nations. Pakistan's exclusion is likely tied to its ongoing tensions with India, particularly over issues related to terrorism and border disputes.

Minister Jaishankar, when asked about the exclusion of these two nations, diplomatically avoided direct comments but emphasized the summit's inclusive nature for all nations genuinely interested in the collective advancement of the Global South. "This summit was about bringing together like-minded countries who face similar challenges and are committed to working together to find solutions," he said.

### **Key Discussions and Outcomes**

The summit was divided into various thematic sessions, addressing critical issues:

- **Climate Action and Environmental Sustainability:** Developing nations reiterated the need for developed countries to fulfill their financial commitments to help combat climate change. The emphasis was on ensuring that the burden of climate action does not fall disproportionately on poorer nations.

- **Debt Relief and Economic Stability:** Discussions focused on the rising debt levels in many Global South countries. Participants called for more equitable financial mechanisms and relief measures to ensure that developing nations can recover from economic shocks, especially in the post-pandemic world.

- **Food and Energy Security:** With the ongoing global food crisis exacerbated by conflicts and climate change, the summit highlighted the need for a coordinated approach to ensuring food and energy security. Leaders discussed strategies for improving agricultural productivity, diversifying energy sources, and reducing dependency on volatile global markets.

- **Reform of Global Institutions:** A strong call was made for the reform of global governance institutions like the United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank. The participants emphasized the need for these institutions to be more representative and responsive to the needs of developing countries.

### **Indiaâ€™s Role as a Leader**

India's role as the host of the summit has been widely recognized as a strategic move to bolster its leadership position in the Global South. By bringing together such a large number of countries, India has positioned itself as a key advocate for the interests of developing nations on the global stage. The summit also aligns with India's broader foreign policy goals of expanding its influence in Asia, Africa, and beyond.

### **Global Reactions**

The summit has drawn attention from around the world, with many praising India's initiative to unite the Global South. However, the exclusion of China and Pakistan has also sparked discussions about the potential geopolitical implications of the event.

Western nations, while not participants in the summit, have shown interest in the outcomes, particularly in areas where cooperation with the Global South could align with their own strategic interests. Meanwhile, China's absence has been noted by global analysts, with some speculating on how Beijing might respond to being sidelined in such a significant gathering of developing nations.

### **Conclusion**

The Voice of Global South Summit has set the stage for increased cooperation among developing nations, with India at the helm. As the summit concludes, the participating countries are expected to carry forward the discussions and work together on the implementation of the ideas and initiatives discussed. The exclusion of China and Pakistan, while noteworthy, does not detract from the broader goals of the summit, which seeks to address the challenges and harness the potential of the Global South in a rapidly changing world.

The coming months will be crucial in determining how the resolutions and agreements reached at the summit will be implemented and whether they will lead to tangible improvements in the lives of the people in the Global South.
