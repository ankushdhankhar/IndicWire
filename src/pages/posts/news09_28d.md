**YSRCP Conducts Statewide Purificatory Rituals to Counter Allegations on Tirupati Laddu Adulteration**

*Amaravati, September 28, 2024* – In a bid to address the growing controversy over allegations of ghee adulteration in the preparation of the sacred Tirupati Laddu prasadams, the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) performed purificatory rituals and pujas at multiple temples across Andhra Pradesh on Saturday.

The move comes in the wake of accusations by former Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu, who alleged that the ghee used in the iconic laddu was adulterated with animal fats. The allegations have sparked outrage, as the Tirupati Laddu is not only a religious offering but also a symbol of spiritual devotion for millions of devotees who visit the world-renowned Tirumala Tirupati temple.

YSRCP leaders have consistently denied the accusations, dismissing them as baseless and politically motivated. To reinforce their stance and restore public faith, YSRCP chief and former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy called for a statewide atonement, urging party members and religious leaders to perform purificatory pujas at temples.

At major temples, including those in Vijayawada, Vizag, and Kadapa, special rituals were conducted, seeking divine intervention to cleanse the perceived taint on the state’s spiritual heritage. The priests leading these ceremonies chanted hymns, offering prayers to restore sanctity to the temple offerings. The participation of religious scholars and senior YSRCP leaders further underlined the seriousness of the initiative.

Addressing the media, a senior YSRCP spokesperson stated, "The Tirupati Laddu holds immense significance for devotees, and any attempt to malign its purity is not just an attack on faith but also on the state's spiritual fabric. The YSRCP stands firm in its belief that these accusations are politically motivated to create unrest. Through these purificatory rituals, we are reaffirming our commitment to the values and sanctity that the Tirupati temple represents."

While YSRCP continues to push back against the claims, Nara Chandrababu Naidu and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) have called for a formal investigation into the matter, demanding that the state government ensure transparency in the preparation and distribution of the laddu.

As the political tussle over the Tirupati Laddu prasadams intensifies, the issue has drawn the attention of religious organizations and devotees alike, with many expressing hope that a resolution will soon be reached to put an end to the controversy.

The YSRCP, in its show of religious solidarity, hopes that the purificatory rituals will not only counter the allegations but also help calm tensions in the state. Meanwhile, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which oversees the preparation of the laddus, has maintained that their process is stringent and adheres to the highest standards of purity, assuring devotees that their offerings remain untainted. 

As the state remains divided on the issue, the sacredness of the Tirupati Laddu remains at the heart of a political debate that has reverberated through both religious and political spheres in Andhra Pradesh.
