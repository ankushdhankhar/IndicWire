**TMC MLA's Controversial Remarks on Brutal Assault of Muslim BJP Member Spark Outrage**

**Kolkata** — In a deeply controversial statement, Hamidul Rahman, a Trinamool Congress (TMC) Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), defended the brutal public assault on Rosonara Khatun, a Muslim member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Rahman’s comments have ignited a political firestorm and widespread condemnation from various quarters.

**TMC MLA’s Remarks**

In a shocking turn of events, Hamidul Rahman justified the assault, stating,**"The woman who was publicly flogged was characterless. In our Muslim Rashtra such societal deliberation and sentencing happens."** Rahman’s statement has been met with severe backlash from political leaders, human rights organizations, and the general public.

**Incident Background**

Rosonara Khatun was attacked in a village near Kolkata, where she was stripped naked, thrashed, and dragged along the road for nearly a kilometre by a group of unidentified assailants. She was hospitalised after losing consciousness, and a police investigation is underway.


**Political Reactions**

Rahman's remarks have drawn sharp criticism from across the political spectrum. BJP leaders have condemned his statement, with party spokesperson Amit Malviya calling it "an endorsement of medieval barbarism" and demanding immediate action against Rahman. 

Rahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, has also been thrust into the spotlight. BJP leaders have questioned his silence on the issue, with many asking, "Where is Rahul Gandhi? Is Democracy and the Constitution not in danger now?" This has added a new dimension to the political discourse surrounding the incident.

**Public and Human Rights Response**

Human rights organizations have vehemently condemned Rahman’s comments. Amnesty International India issued a statement, "These remarks are not only deeply troubling but also indicative of a dangerous mindset that justifies violence and oppression under the guise of moral policing. Such statements undermine the rule of law and human dignity."

Public outrage has been palpable, with many taking to social media to express their anger and demand justice for Rosonara Khatun. Protests have erupted in several parts of the country, calling for accountability and stricter measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

**Legal and Government Response**

The West Bengal government has distanced itself from Rahman's comments. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has condemned the assault on Khatun and assured that the culprits will be brought to justice. "There is no place for such violence in our society, and we will ensure that justice is served," she said.

Legal experts have also weighed in, criticizing Rahman's remarks as being contrary to the principles of justice and the Indian Constitution. Senior advocate Indira Jaising stated, "Such statements are not only unconstitutional but also fuel communal tensions and violence. The law must take its course without any bias or delay."

**Conclusion**

The brutal assault on Rosonara Khatun and the subsequent controversial remarks by Hamidul Rahman have highlighted the urgent need for political and societal introspection. The incident underscores the importance of upholding democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law in the face of rising political and communal tensions.

As the investigation continues, the focus remains on ensuring justice for Khatun and addressing the broader implications of such violence and rhetoric. The nation watches closely, demanding accountability and a reaffirmation of the principles enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
