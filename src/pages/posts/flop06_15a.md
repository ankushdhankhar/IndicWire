**LG Sanctions Prosecution of Arundhati Roy and Dr. Sheikh Showkat Hussain for Allegedly 'Provocative' Speeches**

In a significant development, Delhi's Lieutenant Governor (LG) V Saxena has authorized the prosecution of renowned author Arundhati Roy and former professor Dr. Sheikh Showkat Hussain under stringent sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. This decision stems from their alleged involvement in delivering 'provocative' speeches at a conference held in 2010, titled 'Azadi-the Only Way'.

The LG's authorization follows an FIR filed against Roy and other speakers, accusing them of making statements that could incite public disorder. Specifically, it was alleged that Arundhati Roy, during her speech at the conference, vehemently asserted that Kashmir was never a legitimate part of India, labeling its occupation by Indian Armed Forces as forcible.

According to reports, LG Saxena cited a prima facie case against Roy and Hussain under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 153A, 153B, and 505. These sections deal with promoting enmity between different groups based on religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, assertions prejudicial to national integration, and intentional insults aimed at provoking public disorder.

Section 153A of the IPC addresses actions promoting hostility between various groups, while 153B pertains to assertions undermining national unity and integration. Section 505 deals with deliberate insults aimed at inciting public disorder.

Arundhati Roy, a prominent voice in the literary world known for her critical views on Indian policies in Kashmir and beyond, and Dr. Sheikh Showkat Hussain, former professor of International Law at the Central University of Kashmir, are now set to face legal proceedings based on these allegations.

This decision by LG Saxena has sparked debates regarding free speech and the limits of expression, particularly in sensitive political contexts such as Kashmir. The case is expected to attract widespread attention as it progresses through the judicial system, influencing discussions on civil liberties and national security concerns in India.
