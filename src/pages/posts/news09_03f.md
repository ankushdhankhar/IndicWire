*Brunei Darussalam, September 3, 2024* â€” Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Brunei today for a historic visit aimed at enhancing bilateral ties between India and the Southeast Asian nation. In a special gesture that underscored the significance of the visit, PM Modi was received at the airport by Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, reflecting the warmth and importance Brunei attaches to its relationship with India.

This visit marks the first-ever bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Brunei, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Ahead of his departure, PM Modi expressed his enthusiasm for the visit, stating, "Today, I am embarking on a first-ever bilateral visit to Brunei Darussalam. As we celebrate 40 years of our diplomatic relations, I look forward to my meetings with His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and other esteemed members of the Royal family to advance our historical relationship to new heights."

During his stay, the Prime Minister is expected to hold comprehensive discussions with Brunei's top leadership, including Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah. The talks will focus on expanding cooperation in various sectors, including trade, defense, and cultural exchange. Both leaders are also likely to explore new avenues for collaboration in areas such as renewable energy, healthcare, and education.

India and Brunei share a long-standing relationship, rooted in historical ties and cultural affinities. Over the past four decades, the two nations have built a robust partnership, with cooperation spanning across multiple fields. This visit by PM Modi is seen as a significant step in further strengthening these ties and exploring new opportunities for mutual growth.

In addition to official meetings, PM Modi is expected to engage with the Indian community in Brunei, which has played a vital role in fostering people-to-people connections between the two countries.
