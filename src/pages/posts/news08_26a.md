**Media Groups Urge EU To Sanction Israel For Death Of Journalists In Gaza**

*Brussels, August 26, 2024* — Several international media organizations and press freedom advocates have called on the European Union (EU) to impose sanctions on Israel following the deaths of journalists in Gaza. The demand comes in the wake of escalating violence in the region, which has seen an alarming number of journalists killed or injured while covering the conflict.

The call for sanctions was made ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers scheduled to take place in Brussels on August 29, where the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict is expected to be a key topic of discussion.

### **Alarming Death Toll Among Journalists**

In recent months, the Gaza Strip has witnessed intense military actions, resulting in significant civilian casualties. Journalists, who have been working on the ground to report the situation, have found themselves increasingly in the line of fire. Several have been killed or seriously wounded, raising concerns about the safety of media personnel in conflict zones.

According to reports from local and international media organizations, at least a dozen journalists have been killed in Gaza since the latest escalation of violence began. Many of these journalists were reportedly targeted while performing their duties, raising accusations of deliberate attacks against the press.

### **International Outcry and Demand for Accountability**

The deaths have sparked outrage among press freedom groups, who accuse Israel of violating international humanitarian law by targeting journalists. In a joint statement, a coalition of media organizations, including Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), called on the EU to take decisive action against Israel.

“These deliberate attacks on journalists are a blatant violation of international law and must not go unpunished. We urge the European Union to impose targeted sanctions on Israel to hold those responsible accountable,” the statement read.

The coalition has also called for an independent investigation into the deaths of journalists in Gaza, demanding that those responsible be brought to justice. They argue that the lack of accountability for attacks on media workers contributes to a culture of impunity, endangering journalists worldwide.

### **EU Ministers to Discuss the Situation**

The EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels is expected to address the ongoing conflict and its broader implications for the region. The call for sanctions against Israel adds pressure on EU leaders to take a firm stance on the issue.

While the EU has previously condemned violence against civilians in Gaza, it remains unclear whether the bloc will agree to impose sanctions on Israel. Some member states have expressed reservations about taking such a step, fearing it could further complicate diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.

However, the growing calls for accountability from media organizations and human rights groups may influence the discussions in Brussels. The outcome of the meeting could have significant implications for EU-Israel relations and the broader geopolitical landscape in the Middle East.

### **Ongoing Risks for Journalists**

The situation in Gaza remains highly volatile, with continued reports of airstrikes and ground operations. Journalists on the ground face significant risks, including threats to their safety and challenges in reporting the conflict accurately. 

Media organizations continue to call for the protection of journalists in conflict zones and stress the importance of a free and independent press in documenting and reporting on the realities of war. 

As the international community watches closely, the decisions made by the EU in the coming days could play a crucial role in shaping the future of press freedom and accountability in conflict areas.
