**Mother and Daughter Rescued After Being Bricked into Wall by Relatives in Pakistan's Hyderabad**

**Hyderabad, Pakistan** - In a shocking incident, a woman and her teenage daughter were allegedly bricked into a wall by their relatives following a property dispute. The harrowing ordeal unfolded in the city of Hyderabad, leaving the community in disbelief.

According to local authorities, the dispute centered around a piece of family property that had been a source of contention among the relatives. The situation escalated to a horrifying level when some family members allegedly took the drastic step of imprisoning the mother and daughter within a brick wall.

The incident came to light when neighbors and other locals, noticing the unusual construction and hearing faint cries for help, alerted the police. The authorities quickly responded to the scene, and with the assistance of local residents, they began the arduous task of breaking through the wall to rescue the trapped individuals.

The police reported that both the mother and daughter were found in a state of shock but were otherwise unharmed. They were immediately taken to a local hospital for medical examination and treatment.

"This is a deeply disturbing case," said a senior police officer involved in the rescue operation. "Such acts of violence, especially within families, are utterly unacceptable. We are committed to ensuring justice for the victims and holding the perpetrators accountable."

As the investigation continues, the police have detained several family members for questioning. Initial reports suggest that the property dispute had been ongoing for some time, with tensions mounting to the point of this extreme action.

Local residents have expressed their outrage and disbelief over the incident, calling for swift and stringent action against those responsible. "This kind of brutality cannot be tolerated in our society," said a neighbor. "We hope the authorities will take strict measures to prevent such incidents in the future."

The incident has also sparked a broader conversation about property disputes and the measures needed to address them peacefully and legally. Community leaders and activists are urging families to seek mediation and legal recourse rather than resorting to violence.

As the mother and daughter recover from their traumatic experience, the community of Hyderabad stands in solidarity with them, hoping for their speedy recovery and the swift administration of justice.
