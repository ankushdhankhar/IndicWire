**Harris Decries Trump’s ‘Proposals of Surrender’ as Zelenskyy Visits White House**

*Washington, D.C., September 27, 2024* — During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to the White House, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris fiercely criticized former President Donald Trump’s stance on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Harris, speaking at a press conference, condemned Trump’s recent remarks, which she referred to as “proposals of surrender,” suggesting they would effectively end U.S. support for Ukraine.

Trump, the leading Republican candidate in the 2024 election, has advocated for a swift resolution to the conflict through negotiations with Russia, a position that Harris labeled as “dangerous and unacceptable.” According to Trump, his administration would push for a ceasefire that prioritizes U.S. interests and avoids continued American involvement in what he describes as a “needless and prolonged conflict.” He has criticized the Biden administration’s continued military and financial support for Ukraine, calling it a drain on U.S. resources.

Zelenskyy’s visit comes amid a crucial moment in the war, with Ukrainian forces attempting to hold back Russian advances in the eastern regions. President Biden reiterated the United States’ unwavering commitment to supporting Ukraine, announcing an additional $1.5 billion military aid package to bolster Ukraine’s defense. The aid package includes advanced missile systems, artillery, and air defense systems, a move that underscores the Biden administration’s stance on standing with Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”

Kamala Harris, who has taken a strong pro-Ukraine position throughout the conflict, emphasized that America cannot afford to turn its back on its allies. “What Trump is proposing is nothing short of surrender,” she said. “It is not just Ukraine’s fight; it’s a fight for democracy against authoritarianism. To abandon Ukraine now would send a dangerous message to the world.”

Harris also warned that Trump’s approach could embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling to authoritarian regimes that the U.S. will no longer stand as a bulwark of international democracy.

Trump’s proposals have sparked a sharp divide within the Republican Party. While many of his supporters back his isolationist approach, some GOP leaders, such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have expressed concern over the potential long-term consequences of reducing U.S. involvement in Ukraine. “We must ensure that Russia does not win this war,” McConnell said in a statement.

As the 2024 election approaches, the war in Ukraine is becoming a pivotal issue in the campaign, with starkly different visions for U.S. foreign policy on display. For Harris and the Democrats, continued support for Ukraine is a matter of principle and international stability. For Trump, it’s about avoiding further entanglement in foreign wars and focusing on domestic priorities.

President Zelenskyy, in his remarks at the White House, expressed gratitude to the American people for their steadfast support, noting that U.S. military assistance has been instrumental in Ukraine’s defense efforts. “The people of Ukraine will never forget the generosity and solidarity shown by our American friends,” Zelenskyy said.

The clash between Harris and Trump over U.S. policy on Ukraine is likely to intensify in the months leading up to the election, as voters weigh the country’s role in global conflicts and its responsibility to defend democratic values abroad.
