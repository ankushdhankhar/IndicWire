**Delhi Records Cleanest Air Day Since 2018**

**Delhi reached its cleanest Air Quality Index (AQI) of 53 between January and August for the years 2018 to 2024, according to the Commission for Air Quality Management.**

*Delhi, August 9, 2024* — In a significant environmental milestone, Delhi recorded its cleanest Air Quality Index (AQI) for any day between January 1 and August 8 during the period from 2018 to 2024, as reported by the Centre’s air quality panel, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). This achievement marks a noteworthy improvement in the capital’s air quality, traditionally plagued by severe pollution levels.

### **Improved Air Quality**

According to data from the CAQM, Delhi’s AQI fell into the "satisfactory" category on several occasions this year, with pollutant levels significantly lower than the averages recorded over the past six years. This is a stark contrast to previous years when the city struggled with "poor" to "severe" air quality, particularly during the winter months.

### **Contributing Factors**

Several factors have contributed to this improvement in air quality:

- **Enhanced Regulations**: The CAQM has implemented stricter regulations on industrial emissions and vehicular pollution. This includes the enforcement of emission norms and the promotion of cleaner fuels.

- **Public Transport Initiatives**: The expansion of Delhi’s metro network and the introduction of electric buses have reduced reliance on private vehicles, decreasing vehicular emissions.

- **Green Cover Initiatives**: Efforts to increase the city’s green cover through tree plantation drives have helped in absorbing pollutants and improving air quality.

- **Weather Conditions**: Favorable meteorological conditions, including frequent rains and strong winds, have aided in dispersing pollutants, contributing to cleaner air days.

### **Government Response**

Delhi’s Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, praised the efforts of the CAQM and local authorities in achieving this milestone. “This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of all stakeholders involved in making Delhi a cleaner and healthier city,” he said. The government plans to continue its efforts to maintain and further improve air quality.

### **Future Plans**

The CAQM has outlined several measures to sustain the improved air quality, including:

- **Expansion of Electric Vehicle Infrastructure**: Increasing the number of charging stations and providing incentives for electric vehicle adoption.

- **Promotion of Renewable Energy**: Encouraging the use of solar power in residential and commercial sectors.

- **Awareness Campaigns**: Educating the public on the importance of reducing pollution and promoting eco-friendly practices.

### **Public Reaction**

Residents of Delhi have welcomed the news with optimism. Many expressed relief at the prospect of better air quality, especially for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. Environmental activists have lauded the efforts but emphasized the need for sustained action to ensure long-term improvements.

As Delhi celebrates this environmental achievement, the focus now shifts to maintaining the momentum and building on the progress made. The city’s experience serves as an encouraging example for other metropolitan areas grappling with air pollution challenges.
