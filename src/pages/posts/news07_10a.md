### Maharashtra Government to Offer Free Higher Education for Girls from EWS, SEBC, and OBC Categories

**Mumbai, July 10, 2024** – In a significant move to promote women's education and empowerment, the Maharashtra government has announced that higher education will be free for girls from Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBC), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) starting from the academic year 2024-25. The decision was made during a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde.

The ambitious program, which is expected to cost the state Rs 906 crore, will encompass tuition and examination fee waivers for orphaned students of both genders. This initiative aims to cover a wide range of educational streams including vocational courses, higher and technical education, and fields such as medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, animal husbandry, pisciculture, and dairy development.

**Eligibility and Scope**

The scheme is targeted at female students who apply through the Centralised Admission Process (CAP) to government, aided, semi-aided, and non-aided colleges. This includes polytechnics and autonomous government universities. However, students attending private autonomous universities or self-funded institutions, as well as those enrolling through management and institutional quotas, will not be eligible. To qualify, students must belong to the designated social classes and their families’ annual income should not exceed Rs 8 lakh.

The initiative will benefit both new admissions and current students, providing a significant boost to those who might otherwise be unable to afford higher education. This move is expected to have a transformative impact on the educational landscape in Maharashtra, making higher education accessible to a larger segment of the population.

**Broader Social Welfare Measures**

This educational scheme is part of a broader series of social welfare initiatives introduced in the state budget by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. Among these initiatives is the Mukhyamantri Annapoorna Yojana, which offers three free gas cylinders to women. These programs are aimed at supporting women and youth, enhancing their social and economic standing.

**Political Reactions and Future Outlook**

The announcement has sparked political debate, with opposition parties questioning the funding and accusing the government of using these schemes to attract women voters ahead of the upcoming state assembly polls. However, Chief Minister Shinde has refuted these claims, assuring that the funding for these initiatives is secure and that they are intended to be permanent fixtures in the state’s development agenda.

“This is not about politics; it’s about ensuring that every girl in Maharashtra has the opportunity to pursue higher education and achieve her dreams. These schemes are here to stay and will be a cornerstone of our efforts to promote social and economic development,” Shinde stated.

**Conclusion**

The Maharashtra government's decision to offer free higher education to girls from disadvantaged backgrounds marks a crucial step towards educational equity and empowerment. By removing financial barriers, the state aims to foster an environment where every girl can access quality education and contribute to the state's growth and development. As these initiatives roll out, they hold the promise of creating a more inclusive and progressive society in Maharashtra.
