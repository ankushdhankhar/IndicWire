**More Trouble for Kangana Ranaut’s ‘Emergency’: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) Demands Ban in Punjab**

Amritsar, September 29, 2024 – Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut’s much-anticipated film *Emergency* has run into controversy, with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) demanding a ban on the film in Punjab. The SGPC, a prominent Sikh religious organization, has expressed concerns over what it describes as the film’s historical misrepresentation and “controversial content” that could be harmful to social harmony.

In a strongly-worded statement, the SGPC accused *Emergency* of “spewing poison” by distorting key historical facts related to the 1975 Emergency period imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. According to SGPC officials, the film allegedly portrays certain religious and political figures in an unfavorable light, which they believe could fuel communal tensions in Punjab.

**SGPC's Stand**

SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami called for an immediate halt to the screening of the film in the state, warning that its release could provoke unrest. “We demand an immediate ban on *Emergency* in Punjab. The film’s content misrepresents history and disrespects the sacrifices made by our community during this period,” Dhami said. He urged the Punjab government to take action, adding, “The portrayal of sensitive historical events in a distorted manner is unacceptable.”

The SGPC has also stated that it will approach the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to review the movie again, urging them to cut or remove sections they find objectionable. They argue that the film does not take into account the Sikh community's sacrifices during the Emergency period and presents a biased view.

**Filmmaker’s Response**

Kangana Ranaut, who directed, produced, and stars in the movie, has yet to comment on the SGPC’s latest demands. However, she has previously defended the film, claiming that it aims to "present the truth" about a dark chapter in India's history, which has been largely overlooked by filmmakers.

Ranaut’s portrayal of Indira Gandhi and her government’s actions during the Emergency has already generated heated debate, with some praising the film’s bold take and others criticizing it for potential inaccuracies.

**Growing Controversy**

This is not the first time *Emergency* has faced backlash. Earlier, several political groups and activists had raised concerns over the film’s depiction of key figures from India’s past. The SGPC's demand for a ban, however, adds a significant religious dimension to the controversy, as the committee holds considerable influence over Punjab’s Sikh population.

**Call for Action**

The Punjab government is yet to respond to the SGPC’s demands, but the pressure from the influential religious body is likely to spark a wider political debate. Political observers note that with elections in Punjab on the horizon, handling the *Emergency* controversy delicately will be crucial for the ruling parties.

The SGPC has also threatened to organize protests if their demands are not met, raising concerns over possible unrest. The controversy surrounding *Emergency* highlights the delicate balance between creative freedom and the sensitivities of historical representation in Indian cinema.

As the film’s release date approaches, the tension between the filmmakers and groups like the SGPC is likely to intensify, keeping *Emergency* in the headlines for the foreseeable future.
