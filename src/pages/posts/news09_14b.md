**'Free Bengal from Modi's Rule': Bangladeshi Pro-Al Qaeda Islamist Calls on CM Mamata Banerjee**

**Date: September 14, 2024**

In a startling development, Bangladeshi pro-Al Qaeda Islamist, Jashimuddin Rahmani, has made an incendiary appeal to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, urging her to "free Bengal from Modi's rule." Rahmani, known for his extremist views, also sought assistance from Pakistan and Afghanistan for what he termed as "the independence of Jammu and Kashmir."

### Background of Jashimuddin Rahmani

Jashimuddin Rahmani, a controversial figure with ties to Al Qaeda and other extremist networks in South Asia, is known for promoting radical Islamist ideology. His latest statements reflect a growing trend among extremist elements attempting to interfere in India's internal affairs by sowing discord in sensitive regions.

### The Appeal to Mamata Banerjee

In a message circulating on various social media platforms, Rahmani directly addressed Mamata Banerjee, who has been the Chief Minister of West Bengal since 2011. Rahmani's call to action against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has raised concerns about the potential for external actors influencing internal politics in India.

Rahmani's message called on Banerjee to resist what he called the "tyranny of Modi's rule" and "liberate Bengal from oppressive control." While the message did not contain specific threats, it is seen as an attempt to stoke communal tensions in a politically sensitive region.

### Connection to Jammu and Kashmir

In his message, Rahmani also advocated for the "independence" of Jammu and Kashmir, urging Pakistan and Afghanistan to intervene. His remarks come amid India's continued efforts to maintain peace and security in the region after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status.

Rahmani's call for foreign intervention is being viewed as an attempt to destabilize the region further by seeking support from extremist elements in neighboring countries.

### Response from Political Leaders

So far, neither Mamata Banerjee nor her All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) party has officially responded to the message. However, sources within the West Bengal government have stated that any attempts to disrupt peace in the state will be met with firm resistance.

Political analysts in India have expressed concern that such messages could be part of a broader strategy to destabilize India ahead of key elections in the coming years. With West Bengal being a politically sensitive state, especially in the context of the BJP-AITC rivalry, any external interference could complicate the already volatile political landscape.

### Security Concerns

Indian security agencies are closely monitoring the situation, especially given the potential implications of Rahmani's call for foreign intervention. Intelligence reports suggest that extremist elements across the border may seek to influence political dynamics in both West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir.

Indian intelligence agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA), have been placed on high alert, with investigations into Rahmani's network being expedited. Rahmani's links to global jihadist organizations make this a matter of national security, especially in light of the ongoing geopolitical tensions in South Asia.

### Conclusion

The appeal by Jashimuddin Rahmani to Mamata Banerjee marks a concerning escalation of extremist rhetoric aimed at interfering with India's internal political affairs. As West Bengal continues to be a focal point of political contestation between the BJP and TMC, security experts warn of the need for vigilance against foreign elements trying to destabilize the region.

The central government has yet to comment on the matter, but with tensions already high in the region, Rahmani's statement could lead to further political and security challenges in West Bengal and beyond.
