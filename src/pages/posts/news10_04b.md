**Haryana Election: All Eyes On October 5 As High-Decibel Campaigns End, 1,031 Candidates In Fray**

**Chandigarh, October 4, 2024** â€“ The stage is set for the crucial Haryana Assembly elections, with 1,031 candidates in the fray as the state gears up to cast its vote on October 5. The conclusion of intense campaigning has left the electorate buzzing, as political heavyweights from various parties made their final bids to woo voters. This election holds immense significance, not only for the future governance of Haryana but also for its political alignment on a national scale.

Among the total candidates contesting across 90 constituencies, 101 are women, representing a significant push for gender inclusivity in the state's political landscape. The Election Commission has made extensive preparations, setting up 20,629 polling booths to ensure a smooth voting process. Voters are anticipated to come out in large numbers to decide the next government of the state.

### Key Contenders in the Fray

The election battle will primarily be fought between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the Indian National Congress (INC) headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the newly emerged Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) led by Dushyant Chautala. The BJP is looking to retain power by highlighting its achievements in infrastructure development, employment, and industrial growth during the past five years.

The Congress, on the other hand, is campaigning aggressively on issues like farmer welfare, unemployment, and inflation, hoping to wrest power back from the BJP. The JJP, born out of a split in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), is expected to make the elections a triangular contest, focusing on youth issues, rural development, and job creation.

### Women Candidates and Social Representation

The presence of 101 women candidates marks a notable increase in female participation compared to previous elections. Parties like the BJP and Congress have fielded several prominent women leaders to increase representation and appeal to women voters, who form a significant portion of the electorate. The increased presence of female candidates is seen as a positive step toward greater inclusivity in Haryana's traditionally male-dominated political arena.

### Security and Voting Arrangements

The Election Commission has put in place stringent security measures to ensure peaceful polling across the state. Over 75,000 security personnel have been deployed, along with additional forces at sensitive and vulnerable polling booths. To encourage greater voter turnout, special facilities have been arranged for the elderly, differently-abled, and first-time voters.

Election officials have also launched campaigns to promote voter awareness and participation, urging citizens to exercise their democratic right. With over 20,000 polling stations set up across urban and rural areas, authorities are confident of a smooth and successful election.

### Key Issues and Campaign Highlights

The final phase of campaigning saw a flurry of rallies and roadshows, with party leaders targeting each other on issues such as unemployment, education, law and order, and agriculture. The ongoing farmer protests and regional unemployment rates have emerged as critical concerns, with opposition parties aiming to capitalize on dissatisfaction in rural areas. The BJP has defended its track record, pointing to various welfare schemes, while Congress has promised better support for farmers and economic relief.

Political analysts predict a tightly contested election, with the possibility of alliances playing a decisive role in government formation. The presence of multiple independent candidates and regional parties has made the electoral race more unpredictable.

As the state heads to the polls tomorrow, all eyes are now on voter turnout and the performance of key political players in this high-stakes election.

**Voting Day**: Polls open on October 5, with results expected to be declared shortly thereafter.
