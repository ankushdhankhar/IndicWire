**Title: Accusations Emerge of Organ Theft from Ukrainian POWs by Russian Forces**

**Kyiv, Ukraine â€“ July 27, 2024**

In a chilling revelation, the wife of a Ukrainian prisoner of war has accused Russian forces of engaging in the macabre practice of stealing and selling organs from deceased Ukrainian soldiers. Larysa Salaeva, who leads the Freedom to Defenders of Mariupol group, made these grave allegations, stating that several bodies of Ukrainian soldiers returned from Russian custody were found without vital organs.

### Harrowing Allegations

Salaeva, whose group advocates for the rights and welfare of Ukrainian POWs, expressed her shock and horror upon discovering the mutilated state of the returned bodies. "The bodies we received were not just casualties of war," Salaeva declared in a press conference in Kyiv. "They were desecrated, with vital organs missing. This is a gross violation of human rights and dignity."

According to Salaeva, the extent of organ removal suggests a systematic operation rather than isolated incidents. The group is calling for an immediate international investigation into these allegations to bring those responsible to justice.

### Russian Denial

In response to these serious accusations, Russian officials have vehemently denied any involvement in organ theft. A spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Defense labeled the claims as baseless and a part of Ukraine's propaganda campaign to demonize Russian forces. "These allegations are not only false but also a deliberate attempt to tarnish the image of our military," the spokesperson said in a statement.

### International Reaction

The international community has expressed deep concern over the allegations. Human rights organizations and foreign governments are urging a thorough and impartial investigation. The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has stated it will be closely monitoring the situation and is considering launching an independent inquiry.

### Calls for Justice

The Ukrainian government has echoed Salaeva's calls for an international probe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the alleged actions as a heinous crime against humanity. "We will not rest until the truth is uncovered and justice is served for our fallen heroes," Zelensky said in a national address.

### Context of the Conflict

The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been marked by numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights abuses. The accusations of organ theft add a grim chapter to the already bloody narrative of the war. As both sides continue to engage in fierce combat, the human cost of the conflict remains staggeringly high.

### Conclusion

As investigations proceed, the world watches with bated breath, hoping for clarity and justice. The alleged desecration of soldiers' bodies, if proven true, would mark a significant escalation in the brutality of the conflict. The coming days will be crucial in determining the veracity of these claims and the subsequent steps taken by the international community to address them.
