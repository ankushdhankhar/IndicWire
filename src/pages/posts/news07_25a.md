## Thousands Protest Netanyahu's Address to Congress

**Washington, D.C.** - On Wednesday, thousands of protesters gathered around Capitol Hill in anticipation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to U.S. lawmakers. Demonstrators, many waving Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs, filled the streets to voice their opposition to American support for Israel and to call for an end to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

### Protest Details

The protesters carried banners with messages such as "Stop American Aid to Israel" and "End the War." Among the crowd, signs labeling Netanyahu a "war criminal" were prominently displayed, reflecting the intense emotions and strong opinions held by many of the demonstrators.

### Police Response

As the crowd swelled, tensions rose, and law enforcement officers in riot gear were deployed to maintain order. Just a block from the Capitol, officers began using pepper spray to disperse the more aggressive elements of the protest. Several protesters were detained amidst the chaos, although the exact number of arrests remains unclear at this time.

### Netanyahu's Address

Inside the Capitol, Prime Minister Netanyahu commenced his speech to lawmakers, undeterred by the turmoil outside. His address focused on the security challenges faced by Israel, the importance of U.S. support, and his perspective on the ongoing conflict with Gaza.

### Context and Background

The protests were fueled by a recent surge in violence between Israel and Gaza, which has resulted in significant casualties and destruction. Many Americans, including members of Congress, have expressed concerns over the humanitarian impact of the conflict and the role of U.S. military aid to Israel.

### Reactions

The protest drew a diverse crowd, including human rights activists, students, and members of various political organizations. Some lawmakers also made statements in solidarity with the demonstrators, calling for a re-evaluation of U.S. foreign policy regarding Israel.

### Conclusion

The events of Wednesday highlight the deep divisions and strong sentiments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within the United States. As Netanyahu's speech concluded, the streets around Congress remained a hub of activity, with protesters continuing to voice their demands for change.
