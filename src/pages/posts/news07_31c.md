**Delhi Court Denies Bail to SUV Driver in Old Rajinder Nagar Tragedy**

**New Delhi, July 31, 2024** â€“ A Delhi court has rejected the bail plea of an SUV driver accused of recklessly driving through a flooded road in front of an IAS coaching centre in Old Rajinder Nagar, leading to the tragic death of three students. The incident, which occurred on July 27, resulted in a sudden surge of water breaching the gates of the institute.

### The Incident

On the evening of July 27, the area around the IAS coaching centre was already heavily inundated due to continuous monsoon rains. Witnesses reported that the driver, identified as 30-year-old Rajesh Kumar, drove his SUV through the waterlogged street at high speed. The force of the vehicle's movement caused the water to surge, breaching the gates of the coaching centre and flooding the premises.

### The Tragedy

The sudden influx of water trapped several students inside the building. Despite immediate rescue efforts, three students, identified as Aman Verma (22), Priya Sharma (21), and Rohit Gupta (23), were unable to escape and tragically lost their lives. The incident has left the local community and the student fraternity in deep shock and mourning.

### Legal Proceedings

Rajesh Kumar was arrested on charges of reckless driving and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. His bail application was heard today at the Patiala House Court. During the hearing, the prosecution argued that Kumar's negligent actions had directly led to the deaths of the three students and that granting bail could potentially influence the investigation and pose a risk to public safety.

The defense, on the other hand, contended that the incident was a tragic accident and that Kumar had no intention of causing harm. They argued that he should be granted bail considering his lack of prior criminal record and cooperative behavior during the investigation.

### Court's Decision

After considering the arguments, the court denied the bail plea, stating that the gravity of the incident and the resulting fatalities warranted continued detention. The judge emphasized the need for a thorough investigation and the potential risk to public safety if Kumar were released on bail.

### Public Reaction

The court's decision has been met with mixed reactions. The families of the victims expressed relief, hoping that justice will be served. "We lost our children due to someone's reckless behavior. We hope the law takes its due course and ensures such incidents do not happen again," said Sunita Verma, mother of Aman Verma.

Local residents and students have also voiced their concerns over the safety measures and infrastructure in the area, urging authorities to take immediate action to prevent such incidents in the future.

### Looking Ahead

As the investigation continues, the focus remains on ensuring accountability and addressing the systemic issues that contributed to this tragedy. The court's decision to deny bail underscores the seriousness with which the judiciary is treating this case, reflecting the broader societal demand for justice and safety in urban areas prone to flooding during monsoon seasons.
