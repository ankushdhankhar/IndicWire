### SGPC Issues Color Code for Nishan Sahib: Saffron flag will no longer be hoisted in Gurdwaras

**Amritsar, July 26, 2024** - In a significant move aimed at preserving tradition and religious sanctity, the apex Sikh body, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), has issued a new directive concerning the color of the Sikh religious flag, the 'Nishan Sahib'. The SGPC has instructed gurdwaras worldwide to refrain from using the 'Kesri' (saffron) color for the Nishan Sahib, advocating instead for the traditional 'Basanti' (yellow) or 'Surmai' (greyish-blue) colors.

### Circular and Historical Context

A circular issued by the SGPC on July 26 emphasized the importance of adhering to traditional colors mentioned in the 'Sikh Rehat Maryada' (code of conduct), a document published in the 1930s that outlines the principles and practices for Sikhs. The directive underlines that the Nishan Sahib should represent the authentic values and traditions of Sikhism, which are embodied in the prescribed colors.

The circular stated, "The use of Basanti and Surmai colors for the Nishan Sahib is not just a matter of tradition but a reflection of our rich heritage and religious ethos. It is imperative that gurdwaras globally uphold these values and ensure uniformity in the representation of our sacred flag."

### Reasons Behind the Directive

The decision to issue this directive comes amidst growing concerns within the Sikh community about the dilution of traditional practices. The SGPC has observed an increasing trend of gurdwaras adopting the saffron color for the Nishan Sahib, a practice that, while not explicitly condemned, does not align with the traditional guidelines set forth in the Sikh Rehat Maryada.

The SGPC President stated, "Our aim is to maintain the sanctity and purity of Sikh traditions. The colors Basanti and Surmai have been part of our religious and cultural fabric for centuries. This directive is a step towards reinforcing our collective identity and ensuring that our practices remain rooted in our rich heritage."

### Impact and Response

The directive has garnered a mixed response from the global Sikh community. While many have welcomed the move, seeing it as a necessary step to preserve religious traditions, others have expressed concerns about the practical implications of changing the color of the Nishan Sahib at gurdwaras that have long adopted the saffron color.

A prominent Sikh scholar remarked, "The SGPC's directive is a timely reminder of the importance of adhering to our traditional practices. However, it is also essential to approach this change with sensitivity and understanding, as it involves a deeply ingrained aspect of our religious identity."

### Implementation and Future Steps

The SGPC has assured that it will provide further clarification and support to gurdwaras in implementing the new color code. The body plans to issue detailed guidelines and offer assistance in sourcing the appropriate materials for the Nishan Sahib.

In conclusion, the SGPC's directive marks a significant step towards preserving the traditional values of Sikhism. By emphasizing the historical and cultural importance of the Basanti and Surmai colors, the SGPC aims to reinforce the collective identity of the Sikh community and ensure that its sacred symbols remain true to their roots. The coming months will likely see a concerted effort by gurdwaras worldwide to align with these guidelines, reflecting a renewed commitment to the principles and practices that define Sikhism.
