**Protest Outside UN Headquarters in New York Condemns Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh**

**Date: August 11, 2024**

**Location: New York City, USA**

A large number of people gathered outside the United Nations headquarters in New York on Sunday to protest against the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh. The demonstrators, comprising members of the Indian diaspora, human rights activists, and concerned citizens, called for immediate action to protect minority communities in Bangladesh and ensure justice for the victims of violence.

**Protest Details**

The protestors assembled at Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Plaza, holding banners and placards with messages such as "Stop Violence Against Hindus," "Protect Minority Rights," and "Justice for Bangladesh Hindus." The rally was organized by several diaspora organizations, including the Indian American Community Forum and the Global Hindu Coalition.

Speakers at the protest highlighted the urgency of addressing the escalating violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, calling on the international community to intervene. They expressed concerns over the recent spate of attacks on temples, homes, and businesses owned by Hindus, which have resulted in injuries and loss of life.

**Statements from Organizers and Participants**

"Today, we stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Bangladesh who are facing unimaginable horrors," said Rajesh Patel, one of the organizers. "We urge the United Nations and the international community to take decisive action to prevent further atrocities and ensure the safety and security of minority communities in Bangladesh."

Several participants shared personal stories and testimonies of their relatives and friends affected by the violence. "My family in Bangladesh lives in constant fear," said Priya Sharma, a protestor who traveled from New Jersey to attend the rally. "We are here to demand justice and to let the world know that the violence must stop."

**Response and Demands**

The protestors submitted a memorandum to UN officials, outlining their demands for international intervention and accountability for the perpetrators of the attacks. The memorandum called for an independent investigation into the incidents, protection of minority rights, and implementation of measures to prevent future violence.

The demonstrators also urged the Bangladeshi government to take immediate steps to protect Hindus and other minority communities, enforce law and order, and hold those responsible for the violence accountable.

**Conclusion**

The protest outside the UN headquarters in New York reflects the growing concern among the global community about the safety and well-being of minority groups in Bangladesh. As the situation remains tense, the demonstrators hope that their voices will amplify the call for justice and prompt meaningful action from international bodies to protect vulnerable communities and uphold human rights.
