## Bengaluru is grappling with an acute water shortage

**Bengaluru Faces Severe Water Crisis: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah Takes Action**

**New Delhi, March 19, 2024** â€” The bustling city of Bengaluru, known for its vibrant tech industry and rapid growth, is grappling with an acute water shortage. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently revealed that the city currently faces a staggering **shortfall of 500 million litres of water per day (MLD)**, a significant gap compared to the actual requirement of **2,600 MLDs**. This crisis has prompted urgent measures and a race against time to secure water for the city's residents.

Here are the key points:

1. **Borewells Running Dry**: Out of the approximately **14,000 borewells** scattered across Bengaluru, a staggering **6,900 have already run dry**. These once-reliable sources of groundwater have succumbed to the relentless demand for water, leaving many neighborhoods parched.

2. **Encroached Water Bodies**: Siddaramaiah highlighted that water bodies in the city have either been encroached upon or have dried up. Bengaluru's water requirements are substantial: **1,470 MLD** comes from the **Cauvery River**, while **650 MLD** is sourced from borewells. However, the current supply falls short by about **500 MLD**.

3. **Hope on the Horizon**: The Chief Minister is pinning his hopes on the **Cauvery Five project**, slated to begin in June. This ambitious initiative aims to address the water crisis by catering to **110 villages** that were incorporated into the **Metropolitan Bengaluru Municipal Corporation** back in 2006-07. The project draws from the abundant water storage in the **Cauvery** and **Kabini** rivers, which is expected to last until June.

4. **Additional Measures**: To mitigate the crisis, the state government plans to:
    - **Drill additional borewells** across **313 areas**.
    - **Revive 1,200 inactive borewells**.
    - Implement strategies to **replenish dried lakes**.
    - Utilize **private water tankers**, including those from the **Karnataka Milk Federation**, to provide water to slums, borewell-dependent areas, and villages.

5. **Funds and Future Preparedness**: Siddaramaiah assured the public that the government has adequate funds to provide drinking water. Additionally, a **special committee** will be established to prevent similar crises in the future.

6. **Restrictions**: In response to the water scarcity, the **Karnataka Water Supply and Sewerage Board** has imposed restrictions on using drinking water for car washing, gardening, construction, and maintenance in Bengaluru. The situation has forced residents to rely on private tankers, with the district administration setting rates for 200 such tankers over a four-month period.

As the city grapples with this pressing issue, all eyes are on the Cauvery Five project, hoping it will bring much-needed relief to Bengaluru's parched streets. The urgency of the situation demands swift action, collaboration, and innovative solutions to ensure a sustainable water supply for the city's growing population.
