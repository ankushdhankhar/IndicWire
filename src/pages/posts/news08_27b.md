**Nationwide Protests Erupt in Canada as 70,000 International Students, Mostly Indians, Face Deportation**

**Date**: August 27, 2024

**Location**: Ottawa, Canada

**Introduction**:  
Canada is currently witnessing widespread protests as more than 70,000 international students, primarily from India, are facing the threat of deportation due to recent changes in federal immigration policies. The students, who have completed their studies and are now in the workforce, are demanding an extension of their work permits and a clearer, more accessible pathway to permanent residency.

**Background**:  
Canada has long been a preferred destination for international students, particularly from India. These students contribute significantly to the Canadian economy, both through tuition fees and as part of the workforce after graduation. However, recent changes in immigration policies have created uncertainty and anxiety among these graduates.

The new policies have tightened the criteria for post-graduation work permits (PGWP) and have made it more difficult for international students to transition to permanent residency. The changes include stricter language requirements, increased work experience thresholds, and limited renewal options for work permits. These measures have disproportionately affected students from India, who make up the largest group of international students in the country.

**Protests and Demands**:  
The protests, which began in major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, have now spread nationwide. Thousands of students and their supporters have taken to the streets, carrying placards and chanting slogans demanding justice and fair treatment.

"We came to Canada with the hope of building a future here," said Aarti Singh, an international graduate from India who is participating in the protests in Toronto. "We have invested our time, money, and energy into this country, and now we are being told to leave. It's unfair and heartbreaking."

The protesters are calling on the federal government to reconsider the recent changes and provide an extension of the PGWP. They are also demanding a streamlined process for permanent residency that recognizes the contributions of international students to Canadian society.

**Government Response**:  
The Canadian government has so far maintained its stance on the new policies, arguing that the changes are necessary to manage the immigration system effectively and ensure that only those with the required skills and qualifications are granted permanent residency.

However, the scale of the protests and the growing public support for the students are putting pressure on the government to reconsider its position. Several opposition politicians have voiced their support for the students and have called on the government to address their concerns.

"Canada's strength lies in its diversity and inclusivity," said Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP). "We cannot turn our backs on the very people who have enriched our country and contributed to our economy."

**Conclusion**:  
As the protests continue to gain momentum, the future of these 70,000 international students remains uncertain. The outcome of this situation will have significant implications not only for the students involved but also for Canada's reputation as a welcoming destination for international talent. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether the government will heed the calls of the protesters or maintain its current stance on immigration policy.
