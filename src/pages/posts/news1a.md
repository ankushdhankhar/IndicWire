2. **Construction of roads** on Kadamat Island, Agatti Island, and Kavaratti Island.

These development projects will be funded through the **Sagarmala scheme for port development**. A total of **13 projects** have been identified for the **36 Lakshadweep islands**, which cover an area of **32 square kilometers** and are located **220-440 kilometers** off the Kerala coast in the Arabian Sea¹².

### Sagarmala Programme
The **Sagarmala Programme** is an initiative by the **Government of India** to enhance the performance of the country's logistics sector. Its primary objectives are to unlock the potential of **waterways and the coastline** while minimizing the infrastructural investments needed to achieve these goals²³.

Here are the key points about the Sagarmala scheme:

1. **Vision and Mission**:
   - The program aims to promote **port-led development** in India.
   - It harnesses India's **7,500 km long coastline** and **14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways**.
   - The strategic location of India on key international maritime trade routes is also leveraged.

2. **Components**:
   - **Port Modernization & New Port Development**: Upgrading existing ports and establishing new ones.
   - **Port Connectivity Enhancement**: Improving connectivity between ports and their hinterlands.
   - **Port-led Industrialization**: Encouraging industrial growth near ports.
   - **Coastal Community Development**: Focusing on the welfare of coastal communities.
   - **Project Funding Guidelines**: Ensuring efficient utilization of funds.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The program is managed by the **Ministry of Shipping**.
   - It aims to reduce logistics costs for **EXIM (export-import) and domestic trade**.

In summary, the Sagarmala scheme seeks to transform India's maritime infrastructure, boost economic growth, and create employment opportunities by strategically developing its coastal and waterway assets¹²³. 🌊🚢🏭

Certainly! The **Sagarmala Programme** offers several benefits for India's maritime sector and overall economic growth:

1. **National GDP Growth**: By boosting exports, the Sagarmala scheme aims to contribute to the national GDP growth. It is estimated that it could lead to an increase in exports by **US$100 billion**².

2. **Job Creation**: The program has the potential to create **150,000 jobs** by the year **2025**². These jobs would span various sectors related to port development, logistics, and coastal activities.

3. **Reduced Logistics Costs and Time**: Sagarmala focuses on improving infrastructure for transporting goods to and from ports efficiently and cost-effectively. By streamlining logistics, it aims to reduce the time and costs associated with cargo movement.

4. **Enhanced Global Competitiveness**: As India's maritime infrastructure becomes more efficient, it enhances the global competitiveness of Indian exports. This is crucial for positioning India as a key player in international trade.

5. **Connectivity to Remote Locations**: The recently announced **Sagarmala Seaplane Services (SSPS)** further contribute to connectivity. Under the hub-and-spoke model, remote locations become easily accessible and interconnected. This not only benefits tourism but also aids in the economic prosperity of these regions¹.

In summary, the Sagarmala scheme is a comprehensive initiative that aims to unlock the economic potential of India's coastline, boost trade, and create employment opportunities while improving logistics and connectivity³⁴. 🌊🚢📈
