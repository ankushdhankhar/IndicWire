**Shivaji Maharaj Statue Collapse: MVA to Hold Protest March in Mumbai Today, Security Tightened**

*Mumbai, September 1, 2024* â€“ Mumbai is on high alert today as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), a coalition comprising the Shiv Sena (UBT), Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress, prepares to hold a protest march against the ruling Shiv Sena-BJP-NCP alliance government, also known as the Mayahuti government. The protest, dubbed the "jode maro" (hit with footwear) march, is in response to the recent collapse of a statue of the revered Maratha warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, in Raigad district.

### Background of the Incident

The statue of Shivaji Maharaj, a symbol of Maratha pride and heritage, collapsed earlier this week, sparking widespread outrage across Maharashtra. The incident occurred at the base of Raigad Fort, a site of historical significance as it was the capital of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji Maharaj. The collapse of the statue has led to a war of words between the ruling Mayahuti government and the opposition MVA, with each side blaming the other for negligence.

The MVA has accused the Mayahuti government of failing to maintain the statue and the surrounding infrastructure, calling it a grave insult to Shivaji Maharaj and the people of Maharashtra. In response, the Mayahuti government has launched an inquiry into the incident but has denied any wrongdoing or negligence.

### Protest March and Its Significance

In a show of defiance and protest, the MVA has organized a march in Mumbai today, calling on their supporters to participate in the "jode maro" demonstration. The phrase "jode maro" is a powerful and provocative slogan that symbolizes the intensity of the opposition's anger and the desire to hold the government accountable.

Leaders from all three parties in the MVA, including Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena UBT), Sharad Pawar (NCP SP), and Nana Patole (Congress), are expected to lead the march. They have called upon their cadres and the public to join them in large numbers, urging them to express their dissatisfaction with the Mayahuti government.

The MVA has criticized the government for not only the statue collapse but also for various other issues, including law and order, unemployment, and the rising cost of living. They view today's protest as a significant step in their ongoing campaign to challenge the Mayahuti government's legitimacy and governance.

### Security Measures

Given the tense atmosphere and the potential for clashes, the Mumbai Police have tightened security across the city. Additional forces have been deployed at key locations, including the starting and ending points of the march. The police have also set up barricades and are conducting thorough checks to prevent any untoward incidents.

The Maharashtra government, led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, has appealed for calm and urged the public to maintain peace. In a statement, Shinde assured that the government is taking the incident seriously and will ensure that those responsible for the collapse of the statue are held accountable.

### Public Reaction and Political Implications

The collapse of the Shivaji Maharaj statue has struck a deep emotional chord with the people of Maharashtra, who hold the Maratha king in the highest regard. The incident has provided the MVA with an opportunity to galvanize public sentiment against the Mayahuti government, which is already facing criticism on multiple fronts.

The protest march is expected to be a significant event in the state's political landscape, with potential ramifications for the upcoming elections. The MVA's ability to mobilize large numbers of people and sustain their campaign against the government could influence the balance of power in Maharashtra.

### Conclusion

As the city braces for the protest march, all eyes are on Mumbai today. The "jode maro" march is more than just a demonstration; it is a reflection of the growing discontent among the opposition and a test of the Mayahuti government's ability to manage the fallout from the statue collapse. With emotions running high, the outcome of today's events could have lasting implications for Maharashtra's political future.
