**Portugal Facing 'Difficult Days' as Wildfires Rage Across the Country**

*Lisbon, September 19, 2024* — Portugal is grappling with a severe wildfire crisis as flames continue to spread across various regions of the country. More than 5,000 firefighters have been deployed to contain the blazes, with authorities warning of an "extremely difficult weather situation" complicating efforts.

Prime Minister António Costa described the situation as one of the most critical challenges the nation has faced in recent years. “We are going through difficult days,” he said during a televised address, urging citizens in affected areas to heed evacuation orders and stay indoors where possible.

**Massive Firefighting Operations**

Firefighting personnel, supported by water-dumping aircraft and ground units, are currently battling multiple wildfires, particularly in the central and northern regions. According to the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority (ANEPC), the largest fires are concentrated in the districts of Leiria, Coimbra, and Viseu.

Local communities are facing evacuation, with many residents fleeing as flames threaten homes and infrastructure. Reports suggest that several villages have already been engulfed by the flames, though there have been no confirmed fatalities at this stage. However, the authorities have warned that the rising temperatures and shifting winds could further exacerbate the crisis.

**Challenging Weather Conditions**

Portugal is enduring a prolonged heatwave, with temperatures soaring above 40°C (104°F) in some areas. The hot, dry conditions, combined with strong winds, have created a "perfect storm" for wildfires, making it difficult for firefighters to bring the flames under control.

Costa acknowledged the dire weather conditions and stressed that the country is mobilizing all available resources. “This is an extremely difficult weather situation, which requires us to remain alert and coordinated,” he said. Portugal has also activated its EU Civil Protection Mechanism, seeking assistance from neighboring countries for additional firefighting resources.

**Calls for Vigilance**

Authorities are urging the public to avoid activities that may trigger more fires, such as outdoor grilling or discarding cigarette butts in dry areas. In his address, the prime minister emphasized the need for “collective responsibility” in preventing further outbreaks.

This is not the first time Portugal has faced wildfire devastation. The country experienced deadly wildfires in 2017 that claimed over 100 lives. Efforts have since been made to improve emergency preparedness, but the intensity of this year’s fires is testing the limits of national capabilities.

As the fires continue to burn, many in Portugal are bracing for the coming days, hoping for relief from the ongoing crisis.
