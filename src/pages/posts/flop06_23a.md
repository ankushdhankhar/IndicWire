**Controversy Erupts Over Yoga at Golden Temple: Why the Opposition?**

**Amritsar, June 23, 2024** â€” The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has sparked a debate after filing a complaint against an Instagram influencer for performing Yoga inside the Sri Darbar Sahib premises, more commonly known as the Golden Temple. The incident occurred on June 21, International Yoga Day, when the influencer was seen practicing Yoga in the Sri Darbar Sahib Prakarma, leading to widespread criticism and support alike.

The SGPC, responsible for the management of Sikh shrines, took action following the circulation of visuals showing the influencer engaged in Yoga poses within the revered precincts of the Golden Temple. While many have defended the act as a personal expression of faith and health, others have condemned it, citing religious sanctity and cultural sensitivity.

A spokesperson for the SGPC expressed concern over the incident, stating, "The Golden Temple is a place of worship and sanctity for the Sikh community. Performing Yoga inside its premises can be perceived as disrespectful to the religious sentiments of devotees."

The controversy has ignited a broader discussion on the appropriation of religious spaces for activities perceived as secular or non-religious. Critics argue that such actions undermine the spiritual atmosphere of places revered by millions globally. In contrast, supporters argue for the inclusivity of diverse practices within religious contexts, highlighting the universality of Yoga as a discipline that transcends boundaries.

This incident has prompted introspection within the Sikh community and beyond, questioning the boundaries between personal expression, cultural respect, and religious tradition. While Yoga is widely practiced worldwide for its physical and mental health benefits, its appropriateness within religious spaces remains contentious, particularly in places as esteemed as the Golden Temple.

The influencer in question has not publicly responded to the controversy as of yet. Meanwhile, social media platforms have become battlegrounds for opinions, with hashtags both defending and condemning the incident trending prominently.

As discussions continue, the SGPC's complaint underscores ongoing tensions between modern practices and traditional religious norms, raising poignant questions about the evolving landscape of faith and cultural heritage in an interconnected world.

For now, the fate of Yoga at the Golden Temple remains a topic of intense debate, reflecting broader societal shifts in attitudes towards spirituality, health, and the sanctity of religious spaces.
