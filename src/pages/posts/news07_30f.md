### Indian Youth's Death on Russian Battlefront Sends Shockwaves Among Families

**Kaithal, Haryana** – The news of the death of Ravi Moun, a 22-year-old youth from Matour village in Haryana, on the Russian battlefront has sent shockwaves not only through his family but also among the families of other youths who were coerced into joining the Russian Army. Ravi’s death marks the fifth fatality of an Indian national in the ongoing conflict.

Ravi’s family was informed about his demise through an official communication from the Indian Embassy in Moscow. The Embassy has requested a DNA report from Ravi's mother to confirm his identity. However, since his mother has passed away, the family will be providing the DNA report of his father. Ravi had last spoken to his family on March 12, after which he went missing.

In March, reports emerged about approximately 100 youths, primarily from Punjab, Haryana, and other states including Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala, being deceived by fake travel agents. These youths were led to believe they would be employed as support staff in the Russian Army but were instead forced into the war zone.

The Ministry of External Affairs has called for strict action against the fake travel agents responsible for sending these youths to Russia. In response, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered FIRs against several agents across the country.

### Family's Reaction and Hopes

Sonu Matour, Ravi’s cousin, shared his grief and the family's hopes with The Wire. “I learned about Ravi’s death about a month ago from some other youths who were also on the Russian frontline. I refrained from sharing this news with his family as there was no official communication. We have not yet broken the news to Ravi’s father,” said Sonu.

The family had high hopes that the Modi government would intervene and save their son. This tragic incident has highlighted the vulnerabilities and dangers faced by young Indians misled by unscrupulous agents and caught in international conflicts.

### Government Action and Public Outcry

The involvement of fake travel agents in deceiving youths and forcing them into military service in conflict zones has led to widespread public outcry. The government’s swift response in registering FIRs and taking action against these agents is seen as a crucial step in addressing this issue.

The tragic death of Ravi Moun underscores the need for stringent measures to protect young Indians from being exploited and ensuring their safety when they seek opportunities abroad.

As the investigation continues and families await further information, the community mourns the loss of yet another young life to a distant and deadly conflict.
