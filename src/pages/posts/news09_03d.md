### Kolkata Rape-Murder Case: CM Mamata Banerjee Demands Resignation of PM Modi, Amit Shah After Passing ‘Aparajita’ Bill

**Kolkata, September 3, 2024**: In the wake of a heinous rape and murder incident that has shaken the state, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Her demand comes just days after the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed the controversial West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment Bill, 2024, also known as the ‘Aparajita’ Bill, aimed at strengthening laws to protect women in the state.

#### **The ‘Aparajita’ Bill: A Step Towards Justice**

The West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment Bill, 2024, which has been dubbed the ‘Aparajita’ Bill, was passed with a significant majority in the state assembly. The Bill introduces stringent measures to combat crimes against women, including fast-tracking of rape and murder cases, harsher punishments for offenders, and provisions for better protection and support for victims and their families.

The bill is seen as a response to the recent gruesome rape and murder of a young woman in Kolkata, which has sparked widespread outrage and protests across the state. The incident has also brought national attention to the safety and dignity of women in India, with many questioning the effectiveness of existing laws and the role of the central government in ensuring justice.

#### **Mamata Banerjee’s Strong Statement**

In a fiery speech following the passing of the Bill, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee extended her full support for the legislation and made a direct attack on the central government. She stated, “The ‘Aparajita’ Bill is a necessary step to secure the dignity of women in West Bengal. The time has come to take strong action against those who perpetrate and enable such heinous crimes. If Bengal is abused, it will have a ripple effect across the nation.”

Mamata Banerjee did not stop there. She went on to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, holding them accountable for the growing number of crimes against women in the country. “The central government has failed in its duty to protect the women of this nation. If they cannot ensure our safety, they have no right to remain in power,” Banerjee declared.

#### **Political Reactions and National Implications**

The Chief Minister’s demand has sparked a political storm, with leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing her of using the incident for political gain. BJP leaders have criticized the ‘Aparajita’ Bill, claiming that it oversteps the boundaries of state legislation and could lead to a clash with central laws.

Meanwhile, opposition parties in West Bengal have largely supported the Bill, though some have raised concerns about its implementation and potential misuse. The incident and the ensuing political drama have also reignited debates about women’s safety in India, a topic that has been at the forefront of national discussions for years.

#### **Public Response**

Public response to the passing of the ‘Aparajita’ Bill has been overwhelmingly positive in West Bengal, with many praising the government’s swift action in response to the Kolkata incident. Women’s rights activists have lauded the Bill as a significant step forward, though they stress that its success will depend on effective enforcement.

Protests and candlelight vigils continue to be held across the state, with citizens demanding justice for the victim and calling for stronger measures to protect women. The passage of the Bill has given hope to many, but the demand for accountability from the central government suggests that the issue is far from resolved.

#### **Conclusion**

As West Bengal grapples with the aftermath of the Kolkata rape-murder case, the passage of the ‘Aparajita’ Bill marks a pivotal moment in the state’s efforts to combat violence against women. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s bold demand for the resignation of the Prime Minister and Home Minister signals a new phase of political confrontation, one that could have far-reaching consequences for the state and the nation.

The eyes of the nation are now on West Bengal, as the implementation of the Bill and the political responses to it unfold in the coming weeks. The demand for justice and the call for accountability are louder than ever, and the impact of this moment will likely be felt for years to come.
