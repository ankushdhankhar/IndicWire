**Supreme Court Lauds Centre's Conservation Efforts as India’s Tiger Population Grows by 6%** 

**Date:** August 31, 2024

**New Delhi:** In a significant endorsement of India’s wildlife conservation efforts, the Supreme Court has lauded the Central Government for its sustained efforts in protecting the nation's tiger population, which has seen a commendable 6% growth. This marks a notable improvement in the country's environmental stewardship, underscored by the increase in the tiger population from 2,226 in 2014 to 3,682 in 2022.

**Tiger Conservation Success Story**

India is home to nearly 70% of the world's wild tigers, making the country’s conservation initiatives crucial on a global scale. The rise in tiger numbers over the last decade is a testament to the effectiveness of various programs and policies implemented by the government. These include the expansion of protected areas, anti-poaching measures, habitat restoration, and the involvement of local communities in conservation efforts.

The Supreme Court, while reviewing a report submitted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), expressed satisfaction with the progress made under the Project Tiger initiative. The initiative, launched in 1973, has been instrumental in reversing the declining trend of the tiger population in India.

**Judicial Commendation**

During the hearing, the Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud praised the Centre’s approach to wildlife conservation. The Court noted that the 6% increase in the tiger population over the last four years alone is indicative of a well-coordinated and effective conservation strategy. The Bench also emphasized the importance of continuing these efforts to ensure that the tiger population remains healthy and sustainable.

**Conservation Challenges and Future Goals**

Despite the positive developments, the Court acknowledged the challenges that still lie ahead. Habitat fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict, and the illegal wildlife trade continue to pose significant threats to tiger conservation. The Court urged the government to intensify its efforts in these areas, particularly by enhancing patrolling in tiger reserves, improving corridors between habitats, and addressing the socio-economic needs of communities living in proximity to these areas.

The NTCA, in its report, outlined future goals that include the further expansion of tiger habitats, increased funding for conservation programs, and the adoption of new technologies like drones and AI for monitoring tiger movements and preventing poaching. The authority also highlighted the need for international cooperation, particularly with neighboring countries like Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, to protect migratory tiger populations that traverse borders.

**Global Recognition and Environmental Impact**

India's success in tiger conservation has not gone unnoticed on the global stage. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and other international environmental organizations have recognized India's efforts as a model for other countries struggling with declining tiger populations. The Supreme Court noted that this global recognition reinforces India’s responsibility to continue leading the way in wildlife conservation.

The increase in tiger numbers also has broader ecological implications. As apex predators, tigers play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Their presence indicates a healthy, functioning environment, which benefits a wide range of species and contributes to biodiversity.

**Conclusion**

The Supreme Court's commendation of the Central Government's conservation drive is a significant milestone in India's ongoing efforts to protect its wildlife. With a 6% increase in tiger numbers, the country has demonstrated that concerted, well-planned actions can yield tangible results in wildlife conservation. As India continues to build on this success, the focus will remain on overcoming existing challenges and ensuring the long-term survival of its iconic tiger population.
