**Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah To Be Prosecuted In Land Scam Case**

*Date: August 17, 2024*

**Bengaluru:** In a significant development, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is set to face prosecution in a land scam case that has sent ripples through the state’s political landscape. The case, which involves the alleged illegal allotment of government land to private entities, has been under investigation for several years, with new evidence prompting legal action against the sitting Chief Minister.

### **Background of the Case**

The land scam dates back to Siddaramaiah's previous tenure as Chief Minister from 2013 to 2018. The allegations center around the irregular allocation of a large parcel of government land in Bengaluru to a private company at a price significantly lower than the market value. The deal reportedly caused substantial losses to the state exchequer.

The case resurfaced after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other opposition parties accused the Congress-led government of corruption and favoritism. In response to mounting pressure, the Karnataka government ordered a thorough investigation into the matter.

### **The Investigation**

The investigation was led by the Karnataka Lokayukta, a statutory anti-corruption ombudsman organization in the state. The probe was headed by Lokayukta Justice B.S. Patil, who was appointed to the position in 2022. Under his leadership, the Lokayukta’s team carried out an extensive investigation, collecting documents, statements, and other evidence related to the land deal.

Justice Patil’s team scrutinized the decision-making process behind the land allocation, focusing on the role of various government officials and politicians involved. The investigation revealed a series of procedural violations and alleged abuse of power by senior officials, including Siddaramaiah, during his earlier tenure.

### **Findings and Legal Action**

The Lokayukta’s report, submitted in July 2024, highlighted several key findings:
- The land was allocated to the private company without following proper tendering procedures.
- The price at which the land was sold was significantly below the market value, resulting in a loss of approximately ₹200 crore to the state.
- Several government officials involved in the deal received undue benefits, suggesting a quid pro quo arrangement.

Based on these findings, the Lokayukta recommended legal action against Siddaramaiah and other officials implicated in the case. The report was forwarded to the Governor of Karnataka, Thawar Chand Gehlot, who granted sanction for Siddaramaiah’s prosecution.

### **Political Repercussions**

The decision to prosecute Siddaramaiah has created a political storm in Karnataka. The opposition BJP has seized the opportunity to criticize the Congress government, accusing it of widespread corruption and demanding Siddaramaiah’s immediate resignation.

BJP state president, Nalin Kumar Kateel, stated, "This is a clear case of corruption at the highest level. Siddaramaiah has betrayed the people of Karnataka. He must step down and face the law like any other citizen."

On the other hand, the Congress party has come out in strong support of Siddaramaiah, dismissing the allegations as politically motivated. Karnataka Congress chief D.K. Shivakumar said, "This is nothing but a witch hunt by the BJP to malign our leader. We have full faith in the judiciary and are confident that Siddaramaiah will emerge unscathed."

### **Next Steps**

With the Governor’s sanction in place, the Karnataka Lokayukta will now proceed with filing a chargesheet against Siddaramaiah in the appropriate court. The case is expected to go to trial soon, and the outcome could have significant implications for Siddaramaiah’s political career and the Congress party’s future in Karnataka.

As the legal battle looms, all eyes will be on the courts to see how the case unfolds and what impact it will have on the political scenario in Karnataka.
