### Record Rainfall Causes Severe Waterlogging in Delhi

**New Delhi, June 28, 2024** — In a remarkable and unprecedented weather event, Delhi has recorded 228.1 mm of rain over the past 24 hours, marking one of the wettest spells the capital has ever experienced in June. The torrential downpour led to widespread waterlogging across several parts of the city, causing significant disruption to daily life.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the majority of the rainfall occurred in a short span of time, with over 150 mm of rain recorded between 2:30 am and 5:30 am. This intense rainfall has overwhelmed the city’s drainage systems, resulting in severe waterlogging in many areas, including major roads and residential neighborhoods.

Residents woke up to submerged streets and inundated homes, making commuting extremely challenging. Many vehicles were stranded, and public transportation services faced major delays and cancellations. Schools and offices have been affected, with many opting to remain closed for the day due to the inclement weather and transportation issues.

Emergency services have been working tirelessly to address the situation. The Delhi Traffic Police have issued advisories, urging people to stay indoors and avoid non-essential travel. Rescue operations are underway in several severely affected areas, with efforts focused on draining water from critical locations and assisting stranded individuals.


The Delhi government has activated emergency helplines and set up relief camps for those displaced by the waterlogging. Additionally, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has deployed extra personnel and equipment to clear clogged drains and manage the waterlogged areas.

According to the IMD, more rain is expected in the coming days, although the intensity is likely to reduce. The department has advised residents to remain cautious and stay updated with the latest weather reports. They have also warned of potential landslides in hilly areas due to the heavy rainfall.

### Conclusion

The record-breaking rainfall in Delhi serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by extreme weather events, especially in urban areas with inadequate drainage infrastructure. As the city grapples with the immediate aftermath of this deluge, long-term solutions and infrastructure improvements are crucial to better manage such situations in the future.

For the latest updates and advisories, citizens are encouraged to follow official channels and heed the instructions of local authorities.
