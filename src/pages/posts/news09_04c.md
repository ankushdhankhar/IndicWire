**Direct Flight Between India & Brunei Soon: PM Modi's Big Announcement After Talks With Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah**

*New Delhi, September 4, 2024* — In a significant development that promises to boost bilateral relations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the introduction of a direct flight route between India and Brunei. This announcement followed high-level discussions with Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the monarch of Brunei, during his official visit to India.

### Strengthening Bilateral Ties

The meeting, held in New Delhi, marks a pivotal moment in the diplomatic relationship between the two nations. Both leaders emphasized the importance of strengthening economic and cultural ties, with the introduction of the direct flight route seen as a crucial step in this direction. Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism that the new connection would not only enhance trade and tourism but also facilitate stronger people-to-people contacts.

“India and Brunei share a deep-rooted relationship that is built on mutual respect and shared values. This direct flight will serve as a bridge, bringing our people closer and opening up new avenues for cooperation in various sectors,” said Prime Minister Modi during a joint press conference with Sultan Bolkiah.

### Boost to Trade and Tourism

The announcement is expected to have far-reaching implications for both countries, particularly in the areas of trade and tourism. India, with its burgeoning economy and diverse tourist destinations, is seen as an attractive destination for Bruneians. Conversely, Brunei’s unique cultural heritage and natural beauty are expected to draw Indian tourists, enhancing bilateral tourism.

Business communities in both countries have welcomed the announcement, anticipating that the direct flight will simplify logistical challenges and reduce costs, thereby boosting trade. The flight is also expected to facilitate greater engagement in sectors such as education, healthcare, and information technology.

### Strategic Importance

The direct flight route also holds strategic significance in the context of India’s Act East Policy, which aims to strengthen ties with Southeast Asian countries. Brunei, a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), plays a crucial role in this regional grouping. Enhanced connectivity with Brunei is expected to further India’s strategic interests in the region.

During the discussions, both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, underlining the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight in accordance with international law.

### Cultural Exchange

Cultural exchange was another key area of focus during the talks. Both leaders agreed on the need to promote cultural ties, with the direct flight route seen as a means to facilitate cultural exchanges and mutual understanding. Plans were discussed to organize cultural events, academic exchanges, and collaborative projects in arts and heritage preservation.

### Next Steps

The direct flight service is expected to be operational within the next few months, with airlines from both countries currently in discussions to finalize the details. The route will likely connect major cities in India with the capital city of Brunei, Bandar Seri Begawan.

As India continues to expand its global partnerships, the establishment of direct connectivity with Brunei is seen as a testament to the growing importance of the Southeast Asian region in India’s foreign policy.

Prime Minister Modi’s announcement has been met with widespread approval, both domestically and internationally, as it underscores India’s commitment to enhancing its global connectivity and fostering stronger international relationships.

### Conclusion

The introduction of a direct flight between India and Brunei marks a significant milestone in the relationship between the two nations. It is expected to pave the way for greater economic, cultural, and strategic cooperation, further strengthening the ties that bind these two countries together.
