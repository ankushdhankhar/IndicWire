**AAP Kickstarts Assembly Poll Campaign in Haryana with "Kejriwal Ki Guarantee"**

*Panchkula, Haryana* â€” The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has officially launched its Assembly poll campaign in Haryana, marking the beginning of a new political chapter in the state. In a significant event held on Saturday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his wife Sunita Kejriwal took center stage to introduce a series of promises under the banner "Kejriwal Ki Guarantee."

Sunita Kejriwal, in a townhall meeting in Panchkula, announced the party's commitments aimed at addressing various socio-economic issues in Haryana. This move is seen as AAP's strategic effort to capture the electorate's attention with its unique brand of governance that has been termed "freebies politics" by critics.

**Kejriwal's Guarantees for Haryana:**

1. **Electricity and Water Supply:** Similar to the policies implemented in Delhi, AAP has pledged to provide free electricity up to a certain limit and assured 24/7 water supply to all households.
   
2. **Education and Healthcare:** The party promises to improve the quality of government schools and healthcare facilities. This includes free education and healthcare services, inspired by the successful models in Delhi.
   
3. **Employment Opportunities:** Kejriwal's guarantees include job creation schemes, skill development programs, and unemployment allowances for the youth.
   
4. **Agriculture Support:** The AAP promises to provide substantial subsidies to farmers, ensure timely procurement of crops at minimum support prices (MSP), and implement schemes to reduce agricultural debt.
   
5. **Women's Safety and Empowerment:** The guarantees include setting up more women safety cells, providing free public transport for women, and initiating programs aimed at women empowerment.

In her address, Sunita Kejriwal emphasized the party's commitment to bringing about a transformative change in Haryana, echoing the success stories from Delhi. She stated, "The Aam Aadmi Party is committed to uplifting every section of society in Haryana. Our guarantees are not mere promises but a reflection of our proven governance model."

However, this approach has sparked a debate among political analysts and opponents. Critics have labeled it as "freebies politics," arguing that such promises are unsustainable and can strain the state's finances. They caution that while these guarantees may garner immediate support, they could pose long-term fiscal challenges.

Supporters of AAP argue that these measures are necessary for socio-economic upliftment and can significantly improve the quality of life for the common people. They highlight the success of similar policies in Delhi, where AAP's governance has been lauded for its focus on education, healthcare, and public services.

As the Assembly polls draw closer, AAP's strategy to woo voters with "Kejriwal Ki Guarantee" sets the stage for a dynamic electoral battle in Haryana. The coming months will reveal whether this approach will resonate with the electorate and translate into electoral success for the party.
