**Sanjay Raut Granted Bail After Court Sentences Him to 15 Days in Defamation Case Filed by Kirit Somaiya’s Wife**

*Mumbai, September 26, 2024:* Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut was granted bail just hours after a Mumbai court sentenced him to 15 days in prison in a defamation case filed by Medha Kirit Somaiya, wife of BJP leader Kirit Somaiya. The case centers around Raut’s allegations accusing Medha of involvement in a ₹100 crore toilet scam, which she strongly denies.

The bail was granted by the sessions court shortly after Raut’s legal team filed an appeal against the magistrate court's decision to send him to judicial custody for 15 days. 

### The Allegations
The controversy erupted in 2022 when Raut, in a series of public statements, alleged that Medha Somaiya was involved in embezzling funds meant for the construction of public toilets in Maharashtra. The allegations were part of Raut's broader critique of the BJP and its leaders, accusing them of corruption in various state-run projects.

Medha Somaiya filed a defamation suit, seeking legal recourse for what she described as baseless and malicious charges intended to damage her reputation.

### Court Proceedings
During the proceedings, the court noted that the statements made by Raut could be defamatory, and in response, ordered a 15-day judicial custody. However, Raut’s legal counsel argued that the charges were politically motivated and stressed his right to free speech.

Within hours of his sentencing, Raut’s lawyers moved the sessions court to secure his bail, which was promptly granted pending further hearings in the case.

### Political Implications
Raut’s arrest and subsequent bail have stirred political tensions between the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with both parties exchanging sharp words. The Shiv Sena leader, known for his outspoken criticism of BJP leaders, alleged that the case was a tool of political vendetta aimed at silencing opposition voices.

Kirit Somaiya, on the other hand, maintained that his wife was targeted unfairly by Raut and that the law would take its course in defending her integrity.

The case is expected to continue, with both sides preparing for further legal battles. Meanwhile, Raut’s bail has allowed him temporary relief, ensuring that he can continue his political work without immediate incarceration.
