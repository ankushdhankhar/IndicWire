**Amit Shah Advocates Organic Farming to Combat Fertilizer-Related Diseases, Calls for Cooperative Movement**

**New Delhi, August 31, 2024** – Union Home Minister Amit Shah emphasized the growing health concerns linked to chemical fertilizers, urging a nationwide shift towards organic farming. He made these remarks during a significant address to the nation, highlighting the adverse impact of fertilizers on public health and the environment. Shah called for a robust movement towards organic farming, citing the pivotal role that cooperatives can play in transforming India into the world’s largest producer of organic food.

### The Rising Health Concerns

Amit Shah pointed out that the extensive use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, kidney ailments, and respiratory issues. "The chemicals used in fertilizers are not just harming our soil but are also entering our food chain, leading to a spike in various diseases," Shah stated. He stressed that the health of the nation cannot be compromised, and a transition to organic farming is essential for ensuring the well-being of future generations.

### The Organic Farming Movement

Shah acknowledged the progress made so far in the organic farming movement, stating that it has reached an "important stage" in India. "Our farmers are becoming more aware of the benefits of organic farming, and the demand for organic products is steadily rising, both domestically and internationally," he said. Shah emphasized that this is the opportune moment to scale up efforts and make organic farming a mainstream practice across the country.

### The Role of Cooperatives

Highlighting the role of cooperatives in this transformation, Shah remarked, "Cooperatives have been the backbone of India’s agricultural economy for decades. They have the potential to lead this movement by providing the necessary support and infrastructure to farmers transitioning to organic farming." He urged cooperative societies to take up the mantle of promoting organic farming practices and ensure that farmers have access to resources, training, and markets for their organic produce.

### Government Support and Future Plans

The Home Minister also outlined the government’s plans to support the organic farming movement. He mentioned that the government is working on policies to provide incentives to organic farmers, including subsidies for organic inputs, certification assistance, and the creation of exclusive markets for organic products. Additionally, Shah announced that the government is planning to launch awareness campaigns to educate consumers about the benefits of organic food.

### A Vision for the Future

Amit Shah’s vision is clear: to make India the world’s largest organic food-producing country. He believes that with the collective efforts of farmers, cooperatives, and the government, this goal is achievable. "India has the potential to lead the world in organic farming. We have the knowledge, the resources, and the willpower. Now, we need to come together and make this a reality," he concluded.

As India looks towards a future of sustainable agriculture, Shah’s call to action has set the stage for a nationwide movement that could redefine the country’s agricultural landscape.
