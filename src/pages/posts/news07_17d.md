**Teen Arrested for "Religiously Aggravated" Attack at Sri Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara in Gravesend** 

**Date:** July 17, 2024

**Gravesend, Southeast England** - A 17-year-old boy has been arrested and charged with multiple offences, including threats to kill, following an attack on devotees at the Sri Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara. The incident occurred on July 11, leaving two women injured. Authorities are treating the assault as a "religiously aggravated" crime.

The teenager, whose identity has not been disclosed due to his age, entered the Gurdwara armed with a bladed weapon. During the attack, he reportedly made threats to kill several individuals present at the scene. Emergency services were swiftly called to the Gurdwara, and the injured women were taken to a local hospital where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

Kent Police have confirmed that the boy has been charged with multiple offences, including threats to kill and causing grievous bodily harm. The police are continuing their investigation to determine the full extent of the motivations behind the attack.

Detective Inspector James Taylor, leading the investigation, stated, "This incident is being treated as a religiously aggravated offence due to the nature of the attack and the statements made by the suspect. We are working closely with the Gurdwara community to provide support and ensure their safety."

The Sri Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara, a significant place of worship for the Sikh community in Gravesend, has expressed shock and sadness over the incident. A spokesperson for the Gurdwara said, "We are deeply saddened by the attack on our devotees. Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured women and their families. We thank the police for their prompt response and are cooperating fully with their investigation."

Local community leaders and representatives from various faith groups have condemned the attack and called for unity in the face of such violence. The incident has sparked discussions on the importance of safeguarding places of worship and addressing hate crimes effectively.

The arrested teenager is due to appear in court later this week. Authorities are urging anyone with information related to the incident to come forward to assist with the ongoing investigation.
