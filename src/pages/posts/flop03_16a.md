**Sonia Gandhi**, the Congress president, has been actively involved in **protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)**. Recently, a large number of **Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan** staged a massive protest near the **All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters in New Delhi**. They were **enraged over statements made by India's opposition bloc leaders regarding the implementation of the CAA**. The protestors held placards expressing their resentment against these leaders and raised slogans. The police deployed a heavy force to maintain law and order and prevent the refugees from reaching the Congress headquarters. A tense standoff between the demonstrators and the police was witnessed near Ashoka Road².

One of the protestors, **Hari Kumar**, expressed their frustration: "Be it Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal, or Mamata Banerjee, all are speaking against the government providing us citizenship. We fled Pakistan to save our daughters and mothers. We are the victims of atrocities, and these leaders are against us." Another protester, **Panju Ram**, questioned why other political parties were opposing the CAA when the BJP-led Centre was implementing it to grant citizenship. The Hindu and Sikh refugees also staged a protest near **Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence**, demanding an apology from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader for his statements against the CAA².

In the past, **Sonia Gandhi** has consistently voiced her opposition to the CAA. She has criticized the government's actions and expressed solidarity with people protesting against the act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC)³. Additionally, she led a protest near **Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex** to save the Constitution and express solidarity with those opposing the CAA, NRC, and NPR⁴⁵.

The debate surrounding the CAA remains contentious, with various leaders expressing differing views on its implementation. Sonia Gandhi's active involvement in protests reflects her commitment to defending citizens' rights and voicing dissent against government actions⁶.
