**Saudi Man Jailed for 30 Years for Criticizing Government on Social Media**

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

A Saudi Arabian man, Mohammed al-Ghamdi, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after criticizing the government on social media. His case, which has drawn international attention, is part of a broader crackdown on dissent by the Saudi authorities under the rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Mohammed al-Ghamdi, a retired school teacher, was arrested and charged with using online platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube to post content critical of the Saudi government, its policies, and its treatment of political prisoners. Al-Ghamdi’s posts allegedly called for more political freedom and condemned the human rights record of the kingdom.

### Death Sentence Initially Imposed
Before the 30-year sentence, al-Ghamdi was initially handed the death penalty, according to his family and human rights organizations. This drastic sentence highlighted what many critics describe as a severe crackdown on free speech and dissent under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's de facto leadership. The initial death sentence sparked an international outcry, with human rights groups labeling it an extreme measure aimed at silencing critics.

### International Criticism
The case has intensified criticism of the Saudi regime’s repressive tactics. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called for al-Ghamdi’s immediate release, citing concerns about his right to free expression being violated. Al-Ghamdi's family, who fear for his safety, have expressed concerns over his treatment in prison, alleging that he has been subjected to harsh interrogation methods.

"The arrest and sentencing of Mohammed al-Ghamdi is another disturbing indicator of the tightening noose around freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia," said a representative from Amnesty International. "This extreme punishment is part of a broader pattern of repression seen under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s rule."

### A Broader Crackdown on Dissent
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, since rising to power in 2017, has introduced ambitious reforms through his "Vision 2030" initiative, which seeks to modernize Saudi Arabia’s economy. However, his rule has also been marked by increased repression of political activists, journalists, and critics of the regime. Human rights organizations say the Saudi government has escalated its monitoring and prosecution of social media users as part of its crackdown on dissent.

This case comes in the wake of other high-profile incidents, such as the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the Saudi government, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. International observers argue that the Saudi government is sending a clear message that criticism of its actions, even online, will be met with severe punishment.

### Conclusion
Al-Ghamdi’s case underscores the growing repression in Saudi Arabia, particularly toward those who express dissent online. While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks to transform the kingdom economically and socially, critics argue that these efforts are being accompanied by an alarming erosion of human rights and freedom of expression.

As the global community continues to monitor the case, calls for reform and respect for human rights in Saudi Arabia are likely to grow louder, though the kingdom’s response remains to be seen.
