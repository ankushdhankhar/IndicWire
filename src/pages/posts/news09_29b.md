**Delhi Police Constable Killed in Road Rage Incident; Dragged 10 Meters by Reckless Driver**

*New Delhi, September 29, 2024:* A Delhi Police constable tragically lost his life in a road rage incident late Saturday night in the Nangloi area of West Delhi. The constable, identified as *Vijay Kumar*, was on his way to the police station on his bike when he was fatally struck by a car driven recklessly through the busy streets.

According to eyewitnesses, the 30-year-old constable tried to intervene and warn the driver, urging them to slow down and stop their reckless behavior. The driver, enraged by the officer's request, reportedly accelerated, hitting Kumar and dragging him approximately 10 meters before fleeing the scene.

**Incident Details:**

The incident occurred around 11:30 PM when Constable Vijay Kumar, who was off duty but heading towards the Nangloi police station, spotted a speeding car weaving dangerously through traffic. Concerned for public safety, Kumar signaled for the driver to stop and attempted to confront the individual.

Instead of complying, the driver reportedly escalated the situation, ramming his vehicle into the constable. The force of the impact threw Kumar off his bike, and the car's undercarriage caught onto his body, dragging him down the road for several meters. Eyewitnesses described the scene as horrifying, with onlookers rushing to his aid after the vehicle sped away.

**Police Investigation:**

Delhi Police have launched an immediate investigation into the incident. Senior police officials are combing through CCTV footage from the surrounding area in an effort to identify the driver. A case of murder has been registered, and special teams have been formed to locate and apprehend the suspect.

**Public Reaction:**

The tragic death of Constable Vijay Kumar has sparked outrage among the public and within the police force. Several of his colleagues expressed grief over his untimely death, hailing him as a dedicated and brave officer who always placed public safety above personal concerns. His family, who live in the neighboring district of *Rohini*, have been devastated by the news.

Delhi Police Commissioner *Sanjay Arora* condemned the incident, stating, "This is a heinous act, and we will ensure that the person responsible for this cowardly crime is brought to justice swiftly. Constable Vijay Kumarâ€™s sacrifice will not go in vain."

**Road Safety and Reckless Driving in Delhi:**

This incident has once again highlighted the growing concerns over reckless driving and road rage in the national capital. Despite repeated campaigns to curb such incidents, the city continues to witness frequent cases of road violence.

Authorities are now urging the public to remain calm and vigilant while driving, reminding them of the severe consequences that such actions can bring. Increased police patrolling in high-risk areas is also expected in the coming days to prevent further road rage incidents.

The Delhi Police force is expected to honor Vijay Kumar with a posthumous award for his bravery and dedication to duty. Meanwhile, the search for the accused continues as the city mourns the loss of yet another dedicated officer.
