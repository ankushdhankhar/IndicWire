**Rajnath Singh Urges Residents of PoK to Join India, Criticizes National Conference-Congress Alliance**

**Date:** September 8, 2024

**Location:** Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir

In a bold statement during a rally in Jammu and Kashmir, India's Defense Minister, Rajnath Singh, urged the residents of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to consider reuniting with India. Singh emphasized that India has always viewed the people of PoK as its own and welcomed them to join the country's democratic and developmental path.

"We consider the residents of PoK as our own and urge them to become a part of India. We believe in the principle of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family), and for us, the people of PoK are part of that family," said Singh. He expressed confidence that the region's future would be more prosperous under Indian governance, reflecting the ongoing development efforts in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370.

The Defense Minister did not hold back in his criticism of the National Conference-Congress alliance, which has promised to restore Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir if they come to power. Singh labeled their pledge as a regressive move that would undo the significant progress made in the region over the past few years. 

"The National Conference-Congress alliance's promise to restore Article 370 is a step backward. The abrogation of Article 370 has paved the way for unprecedented development and growth in Jammu and Kashmir. Reinstating it would only take us back to the era of separatism and stagnation," Singh asserted.

He highlighted several development projects and initiatives that have been implemented in Jammu and Kashmir since the special status was revoked in August 2019. Singh pointed out improvements in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, along with the boost to tourism and investment in the region. He assured that the central government remains committed to ensuring the peace, stability, and prosperity of Jammu and Kashmir.

Rajnath Singh's remarks come at a time of heightened political activity in the region, with various parties vying for influence ahead of upcoming elections. The BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, continues to champion the decision to abrogate Article 370 as a milestone achievement that has integrated Jammu and Kashmir more closely with the rest of India.

The Defense Minister's call to the people of PoK is seen as a reaffirmation of India's stance on the region and a message to both domestic and international audiences about India's commitment to reclaiming the territories under Pakistani control. His speech has been met with support from BJP cadres, who see it as a strong articulation of the party's nationalist agenda.

As the political discourse in Jammu and Kashmir intensifies, Singh's statement is likely to further polarize opinions on the issue of Article 370 and the future of the region, setting the stage for a contentious election season.
