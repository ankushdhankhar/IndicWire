**PM Modi Attends Ganpati Puja at Chief Justice's Residence, Sparks Political Row**

New Delhi, **Sept 2024**: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud’s residence for Ganpati Puja has stirred a political controversy, with opposition parties raising concerns over the optics of the event. The visit, which took place amid the festive celebration, has led to speculation and sharp criticism from some political quarters, questioning the propriety of the meeting between the head of the executive and the judiciary in a social setting.

### **The Invitation**
According to top government sources, CJI Chandrachud had extended formal invitations to several dignitaries, including Prime Minister Modi, for the Ganpati Puja at his residence. The event was part of a traditional celebration, and many from the political, judicial, and social sectors were in attendance. The Chief Justice's office, in a statement, emphasized the religious and festive nature of the occasion, downplaying any political interpretations of the gathering.

### **Political Reactions**
Despite these clarifications, opposition parties, including the Congress and some legal experts, have expressed concerns about the implications of such interactions, especially at a time when several significant cases are being heard by the Supreme Court. Critics argue that even casual social interactions between the Prime Minister and the CJI can lead to perceptions of bias and undermine the independence of the judiciary.

Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh questioned the timing and optics of the visit, stating, "It is important for the judiciary to remain above suspicion. When the head of the judiciary and the head of the executive meet, especially in these politically charged times, it raises questions about the separation of powers."

AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi also weighed in, saying that such meetings could create an impression of undue influence on the judiciary, which is expected to function independently of the executive.

### **Government's Response**
In response to the criticism, government officials reiterated that the event was purely a religious celebration, and no political discussions took place. They highlighted that the Prime Minister, like any other invited guest, attended the puja to pay respect to the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, a tradition followed across India. “The criticism is unwarranted and only serves to politicize a religious and cultural event,” said a senior government official.

BJP leaders also defended the Prime Minister’s visit, accusing the opposition of making baseless allegations. "The Prime Minister’s participation in cultural and religious events is part of his role as a leader who celebrates India’s diverse traditions," said BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia.

### **Judicial Independence in Focus**
The row over the Ganpati Puja has reignited debates about the delicate balance between the judiciary and the executive. Legal experts point out that while social gatherings are normal, the perception of closeness between these two branches of government can sometimes be problematic, particularly when high-profile cases are in progress.

Justice (Retd.) A.P. Shah remarked, “There is a need for both the judiciary and executive to maintain a clear and visible separation, not just in professional settings but also in social ones, especially given the public scrutiny both offices are under.”

### **Conclusion**
As the controversy unfolds, both the government and the judiciary are likely to face increased scrutiny regarding their relationship. While the Ganpati Puja was meant to be a celebration of faith, the political firestorm that followed has once again put the spotlight on the independence of India’s democratic institutions.
