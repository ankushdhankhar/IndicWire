India has announced plans to **fortify its 1,643-kilometer border with Myanmar** by constructing a fence, mirroring the security measures already in place along the Bangladesh frontier. Union Home Minister Amit Shah disclosed this decision during his visit to Assam, emphasizing the government's commitment to bolstering national security¬π. The initiative aims to enhance surveillance and curb unauthorized crossings, with initial fencing efforts already underway in Manipur. Additionally, India intends to **revoke the free movement regime agreement with Myanmar**, which allowed border residents to travel up to 16 kilometers into each other's territory without visas. This signifies a significant shift in regional dynamics¬π. 

The proposed border fence faces logistical challenges, particularly given the rugged terrain of the region. However, experts caution against the potential destabilization of regional equilibrium and strained bilateral relations¬π. The construction of fencing for a border length of 10.023 kilometers at Moreh in Manipur has already been awarded to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), with work in progress and 6.812 kilometers of fencing already completed¬≥. The move comes amidst escalating conflicts and ethnic tensions in the region, including the military coup in Myanmar and ethnic violence in Manipur, highlighting the need for heightened security measures¬π. üõ°Ô∏èüåè

The construction of a fortified fence along the Indo-Myanmar border could have implications for trade between India and Myanmar. While the primary objective is to enhance security and curb unauthorized crossings, it may inadvertently impact cross-border economic activities. Here are some potential effects:

1. **Trade Disruptions**: The border fence could hinder the movement of goods and people across the border. Existing trade routes may face disruptions, affecting bilateral trade between the two countries.

2. **Customs and Border Checks**: With increased security measures, customs and border checks may become more stringent. This could lead to delays in cargo clearance and additional paperwork for traders.

3. **Informal Trade**: The Indo-Myanmar border has witnessed significant informal trade, including the exchange of goods by local communities. The fence may discourage such informal trade, affecting livelihoods and local economies.

4. **Formal Trade Routes**: India and Myanmar have established formal trade routes, including the Moreh-Tamu border crossing. The fence may impact the efficiency of these routes, necessitating adjustments and coordination.

5. **Diplomatic Relations**: The decision to revoke the free movement regime agreement could strain diplomatic relations between the two countries. Myanmar may view this as a restrictive measure affecting people-to-people ties.

6. **Regional Cooperation**: The fence construction may prompt discussions on border management and cooperation. Both countries need to balance security concerns with facilitating legitimate trade and movement.

In summary, while the border fence aims to enhance security, its impact on trade will depend on how effectively both nations manage the transition and address potential challenges. Close coordination and dialogue will be crucial to mitigate any adverse effects on bilateral trade and relations. üåêü§ù
