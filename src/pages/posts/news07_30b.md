### Indian Navy to Acquire Three More Scorpene-Class Submarines with Indigenous Combat Systems

**New Delhi, July 30, 2024** â€” In a significant boost to India's naval capabilities and defense manufacturing, the Indian Navy is set to acquire three more Scorpene-class submarines. These submarines will feature a combat management system (CMS) made in India by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), in collaboration with French defense major Naval Group.

The decision to procure additional Scorpene-class submarines comes as part of India's ongoing efforts to modernize its naval fleet and enhance underwater warfare capabilities. The Scorpene-class submarines are renowned for their stealth, advanced sonar capabilities, and long-range attack potential.

#### **Indigenous Development of Combat Systems**

Naval Group, the French partner for the Scorpene submarine project, announced that the CMS, which serves as the heart of the submarine's combat operations, will be manufactured in India. BEL, a leading state-owned defense electronics company, will be responsible for developing the CMS. This move aligns with India's "Make in India" initiative, aimed at promoting indigenous production and reducing dependency on foreign technology.

The CMS will be supported by architecture from France, ensuring that the system benefits from the latest technological advancements and operational expertise. This collaboration is expected to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Navy while fostering greater self-reliance in defense technology.

#### **Enhanced Capabilities**

The Scorpene-class submarines are equipped with a range of sophisticated technologies, including advanced sonar systems for detecting enemy submarines and ships, as well as state-of-the-art torpedo and missile systems. The addition of an indigenously developed CMS will further enhance these submarines' operational effectiveness.

The CMS integrates various subsystems, including sensors, weapons, and communication systems, to provide a comprehensive situational awareness and control environment. This allows the submarine crew to make informed decisions rapidly, ensuring mission success in complex and hostile environments.

#### **Strategic Importance**

The acquisition of these submarines is a strategic move to bolster India's maritime security, particularly in the Indian Ocean region, where geopolitical tensions and maritime threats have been on the rise. The Scorpene-class submarines, with their advanced stealth capabilities and offensive power, will significantly enhance the Indian Navy's deterrence and operational reach.

#### **Collaboration and Future Prospects**

The collaboration between BEL and Naval Group underscores the strong defense ties between India and France. It also opens up opportunities for future technological exchanges and joint ventures in defense manufacturing.

"The development of the CMS in India is a testament to the growing capabilities of our defense industry," said a spokesperson for Bharat Electronics Limited. "We are proud to contribute to the Indian Navy's modernization efforts and look forward to further strengthening our partnership with Naval Group."

As the Indian Navy continues to expand its fleet and capabilities, the focus on indigenous production and international collaboration will remain key to achieving self-reliance in defense and securing the nation's maritime interests.
