**Controversy Erupts as BJP MP Chhatrapal Singh Gangwar Proclaims 'Jai Hindu Rashtra' During Oath Ceremony**

In a startling turn of events during the oath-taking ceremony for Members of Parliament, Chhatrapal Singh Gangwar, newly elected BJP MP from Bareilly, sparked controversy by proclaiming 'Jai Hindu Rashtra' while taking his oath. The incident occurred in the hallowed halls of the Lok Sabha, sending ripples of surprise and concern throughout the political landscape.

Gangwar, known for his outspoken views on Hindutva and nationalist ideologies, took his oath in Hindi, concluding it with the controversial slogan 'Jai Hindu Rashtra'. This proclamation, although resonating with a segment of the ruling party's core supporters, immediately drew criticism from opposition members and raised questions about the secular fabric of the Indian Parliament.

The Congress party and other opposition leaders swiftly condemned Gangwar's statement, labeling it divisive and against the pluralistic ethos of India's Constitution. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "The Constitution of India envisions a pluralistic society where diversity is celebrated. Such statements are an insult to the inclusive spirit of our nation."

Meanwhile, BJP officials have been relatively muted in their response, with some party leaders distancing themselves from Gangwar's remarks, suggesting they do not reflect the party's official stance. However, within social media circles and right-wing groups, there has been support for Gangwar's assertion, arguing that it reflects a pride in India's Hindu heritage.

The incident has reignited debates on the boundaries of religious expression within the parliamentary framework. While MPs are allowed to take oaths in any of the 22 scheduled languages or English, the inclusion of religious or political slogans during the oath has traditionally been frowned upon as it could be seen as undermining the secular nature of the Indian state.

This controversy comes at a time when communal tensions have been simmering in various parts of the country, and political rhetoric has often been accused of exacerbating divisions rather than fostering unity. Critics argue that statements like Gangwar's risk deepening these fault lines and pose a challenge to the fundamental principles of India's democracy.

As the nation grapples with this latest controversy, the spotlight remains on how political leaders and parties navigate the delicate balance between individual expression and the responsibility of upholding constitutional values in public office.
