**BJP's Sunil Deodhar Advocates Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar Amidst Maharashtra Poll Campaign**

*Mumbai, August 3, 2024* — As the Maharashtra Assembly Elections draw near, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sunil Deodhar has stirred a fresh debate by advocating for the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award, to be conferred upon Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, widely regarded as the father of Hindutva. Deodhar's comments come amidst a flurry of political activity and discussions about the role of Hindutva in the state's politics.

During a public rally in Mumbai, Deodhar stated, "Honoring Veer Savarkar with the Bharat Ratna will not only acknowledge his immense contribution to the nation but also elevate the prestige of the award itself. Savarkar’s vision and ideology have played a pivotal role in shaping modern India’s identity."

### Historical Context

Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, often referred to as Veer Savarkar, was a prominent freedom fighter and a key ideologue in the formation of the Hindutva philosophy. His contributions to the Indian independence movement and his writings on Hindutva have made him a significant, albeit controversial, figure in Indian history. 

The demand to honor Savarkar with the Bharat Ratna is not new. Several BJP leaders and right-wing organizations have previously called for such recognition, arguing that his contributions to the nation have been overlooked for decades.

### Political Reactions

Deodhar’s statement has elicited mixed reactions from political parties and leaders across the spectrum. The Shiv Sena, an ally of the BJP in the state, expressed support for the proposal, citing Savarkar’s legacy as integral to Maharashtra’s history. 

In contrast, the opposition Congress party has criticized the move, arguing that it is an attempt to polarize voters along religious lines ahead of the elections. "This is a blatant strategy to divert attention from pressing issues like unemployment and inflation," said a Congress spokesperson.

### Electoral Implications

With the Maharashtra Assembly Elections looming, Deodhar’s remarks are likely to influence the electoral dynamics. The BJP has been emphasizing Hindutva as a core element of its campaign strategy, aiming to consolidate its support base among Hindu voters. 

Political analysts suggest that raising the issue of awarding the Bharat Ratna to Savarkar could galvanize BJP supporters while also drawing criticism from secular and liberal sections of society.

### Conclusion

As the debate over Savarkar’s legacy continues to resonate in Maharashtra, the demand for his recognition with the Bharat Ratna remains a contentious topic. Whether this will translate into electoral gains for the BJP in the upcoming elections remains to be seen.

The Maharashtra Assembly Elections are scheduled to be held later this year, with all major parties gearing up for what promises to be a fiercely contested political battle.
