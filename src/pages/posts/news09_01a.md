**Tejashwi Yadav Criticizes Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, Refers to Him as 'Chinese Version of Yogi', BJP Calls Remark 'Racist'** 

**Date:** September 1, 2024

**Location:** Patna, Bihar

In a recent political confrontation, Bihar’s RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav took a sharp jab at Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, referring to him as a "Chinese version of Yogi Adityanath." This remark was made in the context of Sarma's controversial decision to end the Jumma break for Muslim employees in Assam, a move that has sparked significant debate across the country.

### **Tejashwi Yadav’s Remarks:**

Tejashwi Yadav accused Himanta Biswa Sarma of attempting to gain cheap popularity through divisive actions. "Assam Chief Minister wants cheap popularity and wants to remain in the news... (UP CM) Yogi Adityanath is using bulldozers, and he (Assam CM) is stopping namaz," Yadav said. He criticized Sarma for allegedly trying to emulate Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, but in a way that Yadav believes is less impactful and more superficial, hence the comparison to a "Chinese version."

Yadav’s comments came after Sarma's government decided to discontinue the traditional Jumma break, which allowed Muslim employees to attend Friday prayers. The move has been interpreted by some as an attempt to align Assam’s policies more closely with those in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, where Yogi Adityanath has been known for his hardline stance on law and order, particularly with the use of bulldozers against alleged illegal properties linked to criminals.

### **BJP’s Response:**

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) quickly responded to Yadav's remarks, terming them "racist" and "insensitive." The party's spokesperson accused Tejashwi Yadav of engaging in petty and divisive politics. "By calling Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma a 'Chinese version' of Yogi Adityanath, Tejashwi Yadav has not only insulted the Chief Minister but also shown his shallow understanding of governance and development. Such remarks are not just unbecoming of a leader but are also a reflection of his desperation to stay relevant," the spokesperson said.

The BJP defended Sarma's decision, arguing that it was a step toward ensuring equal treatment of all employees, regardless of religion. They accused the opposition of trying to communalize the issue for political gain.

### **Background:**

Himanta Biswa Sarma, known for his strong stance on issues related to national security and religious practices, recently decided to abolish the Jumma break, stating that it was in line with the principle of equal work hours for all employees. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with supporters praising it as a move toward uniformity and detractors accusing it of being an attack on religious freedom.

This clash between Tejashwi Yadav and Himanta Biswa Sarma reflects the broader political dynamics in India, where state leaders often become symbols of larger ideological battles. Yadav’s comparison to Yogi Adityanath is particularly pointed, as Adityanath is often seen as a symbol of the BJP’s aggressive Hindutva agenda, something that the opposition has frequently criticized.

### **Conclusion:**

The political slugfest between Tejashwi Yadav and the BJP is indicative of the heightened tensions as leaders from different states clash over policies and ideologies. As the 2024 general elections approach, such confrontations are likely to intensify, with leaders using every opportunity to criticize their opponents and galvanize their support bases. The public response to this latest incident will likely play a role in shaping the narrative around religious and political identity in the coming months.
