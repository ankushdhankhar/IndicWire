### Centre Announces New Pension Scheme: Employees to Receive Assured Minimum Fund

**New Delhi, August 24, 2024** â€” The Government of India has introduced a new pension scheme aimed at ensuring financial security for its employees post-retirement. The scheme, which was officially announced by the Ministry of Finance today, guarantees a pension that constitutes 50 percent of the average basic pay drawn during the last 12 months before superannuation. This initiative is expected to provide significant relief to government employees, particularly those who have dedicated a substantial portion of their careers to public service.

#### **Key Features of the New Pension Scheme**

1. **Assured Pension Fund**: The scheme guarantees that all eligible employees will receive a pension amounting to 50 percent of their average basic pay during the final year of their service. This provision ensures that employees maintain a stable income even after retirement.

2. **Eligibility Criteria**: To qualify for this pension scheme, employees must have completed a minimum of 25 years of continuous service in any government department or public sector undertaking. This criterion emphasizes the scheme's focus on rewarding long-term commitment and service.

3. **Calculation of Pension**: The pension will be calculated based on the average basic pay drawn by the employee over the last 12 months of their service. This method is expected to offer a more realistic reflection of the employee's financial status during the final stages of their career.

4. **Implementation and Coverage**: The new pension scheme will be applicable to all central government employees who meet the eligibility criteria. It is also expected to be extended to employees of certain public sector enterprises (PSEs) and autonomous bodies under the central government.

#### **Government's Perspective**

Speaking at the announcement, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman emphasized the importance of financial security for government employees. "Our government is committed to ensuring that those who have dedicated their lives to public service can retire with dignity. This pension scheme is a significant step in that direction," she stated.

The Minister also highlighted that this initiative is part of the government's broader efforts to reform and improve the welfare of its employees. "We have taken into account the rising cost of living and the financial needs of retirees. This scheme is designed to provide them with a stable and assured income," she added.

#### **Employee Reactions**

The announcement has been met with a positive response from various employee unions and associations. The Confederation of Central Government Employees and Workers (CCGEW) welcomed the scheme, describing it as a "long-overdue reform." The General Secretary of CCGEW, R. Chandrasekhar, commented, "This is a much-needed initiative that recognizes the contribution of government employees. The assurance of a minimum pension fund will bring peace of mind to many retirees."

However, some concerns were raised regarding the scheme's eligibility criteria. Employees nearing retirement but who have not completed 25 years of service may not benefit from the scheme, leading to calls for a more inclusive approach.

#### **Future Prospects and Implementation**

The Ministry of Finance has assured that the implementation process will be smooth, with clear guidelines and timelines provided to all concerned departments. The government is expected to set up a dedicated portal to handle queries and facilitate the transition to the new scheme for eligible employees.

In conclusion, the introduction of this new pension scheme marks a significant development in the Indian government's efforts to enhance the welfare of its employees. With the assurance of a minimum pension fund, employees can look forward to a more secure and financially stable retirement.
