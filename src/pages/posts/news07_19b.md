**National Highways Authority of India Imposes Double Toll Fee for Non-FASTag Users**

**New Delhi, July 19, 2024** – In a decisive move aimed at ensuring seamless toll collection and reducing traffic congestion, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has announced that vehicles not equipped with FASTag will now be required to pay double the standard toll fee. This guideline is part of NHAI's ongoing efforts to promote the widespread adoption of electronic toll collection systems across the country.

### The New Directive

The new directive, effective immediately, mandates that any vehicle without a functional FASTag affixed to its windscreen will be charged double the usual toll fee at all national highway toll plazas. This measure is designed to deter drivers from bypassing the FASTag system, which has been instrumental in reducing wait times and enhancing the efficiency of toll operations.

### The Importance of FASTag

FASTag is a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag that enables automatic deduction of toll charges, allowing vehicles to pass through toll plazas without stopping for cash transactions. Introduced as part of the government's push towards a cashless and digital economy, FASTag has significantly cut down on the time spent at toll booths, thereby reducing fuel consumption and vehicular emissions.

### Compliance and Enforcement

To enforce compliance, NHAI has directed toll plaza operators to ensure that every lane is equipped with the necessary infrastructure to identify and process non-FASTag vehicles. These vehicles will be flagged and subjected to the higher toll fee as stipulated. Additionally, NHAI is working closely with traffic police and road transport authorities to spread awareness about the new guidelines and ensure stringent enforcement.

### Impact on Commuters

While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, many commuters understand the long-term benefits of the FASTag system. “This move will encourage more people to switch to FASTag, which is ultimately more convenient and time-saving,” said Ramesh Kumar, a daily commuter on the Delhi-Jaipur highway. However, some drivers have expressed concerns over the immediate financial burden, especially for those who infrequently use highways.

### Government’s Response

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has assured the public that ample time and resources have been provided to adopt FASTag. “We have made FASTag available at numerous points, including toll plazas, banks, and online platforms. There is no reason for vehicle owners to delay this transition,” a spokesperson from MoRTH stated.

### Conclusion

The NHAI’s latest directive underscores the government’s commitment to modernizing the country’s infrastructure and promoting digital transactions. As more vehicles comply with the FASTag system, the benefits of reduced congestion, lower emissions, and smoother travel will be realized, marking a significant step forward in India’s road transport sector.

For more information on obtaining a FASTag and details on the new toll fee structure, vehicle owners are encouraged to visit the official NHAI website or contact their nearest toll plaza.
