# Warship INS Kolkata Carries Apprehended Pirates to Mumbai

**Mumbai, March 23, 2024** â€” The Indian Navy's warship **INS Kolkata** successfully completed a critical mission, bringing **35 apprehended pirates** to the bustling port city of Mumbai. These pirates, who were captured during an operation off the coast of Somalia, have now been handed over to the local police for further legal proceedings.

## Operation Sankalp: Safeguarding Seafarers and Trade

The daring operation was part of the ongoing **Operation Sankalp**, a strategic initiative by the Indian Navy. Under this mission, naval vessels patrol the **Arabian Sea** and the **Gulf of Aden**, ensuring the safety of seafarers and protecting mercantile trade routes that traverse these waters. The region has witnessed its fair share of piracy threats, and the deployment of INS Kolkata exemplifies India's commitment to maritime security.

## The Apprehension

In an intense operation lasting over **40 hours**, INS Kolkata intercepted the pirate ship **ex-MV Ruen** in the Arabian Sea. The Indian Navy acted swiftly based on intelligence received from the **United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO)**. The pirate vessel, which had been menacing merchant ships, was being used as a **Mother Ship** for piracy attacks and hijackings.

## The Showdown

As INS Kolkata shadowed the pirate ship, the situation escalated. Armed pirates were spotted on the upper deck, and the vessel altered its course, heading toward the Somali coast. The Indian Navy followed international protocols, directing the pirate ship to stop for investigation. However, the pirates refused to comply and opened fire.

In a decisive move, INS Kolkata invoked self-defense measures, using kinetic force to disable the pirate ship and compel the surrender of all onboard. The operation was a joint effort, with **INS Subhadra** joining INS Kolkata in the pursuit.

## Airborne Support

The Indian Navy didn't stop there. Aerial surveillance played a crucial role. Marine Commandos were paradropped over the sea near the pirate ship using **C17s** in coordination with the Indian Air Force. Surveillance aircraft, including the **P8I**, **Sea Guardian UAV**, and the ship's integral helicopters, provided real-time intelligence.

## Surrender and Legal Handover

Facing the might of the Indian Navy, the pirates surrendered. On **March 23, 2024**, INS Kolkata returned to Mumbai, carrying the apprehended pirates. They were promptly handed over to the local police, who will initiate legal proceedings under the **Maritime Anti Piracy Act 2022**.

This successful operation underscores India's commitment to securing vital sea lanes and ensuring the safety of seafarers navigating treacherous waters. As the pirates face justice, INS Kolkata stands as a symbol of unwavering resolve in the fight against maritime threats.
