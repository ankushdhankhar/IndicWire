**Sunita Williams Rescue Mission Set to Launch Tonight as NASA Green Lights Crew-9**

**Cape Canaveral, September 28, 2024** – NASA has given the green light for the highly anticipated launch of Crew-9, a mission that includes veteran astronaut Sunita Williams. The mission is set to lift off tonight from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after a brief delay caused by adverse weather conditions brought on by Hurricane Helene. Originally scheduled for September 26, the launch was postponed to ensure safety as the Gulf Coast faced high winds and torrential rainfall.

NASA has confirmed that the weather is now favorable for the launch. Crew-9 will be using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which will propel the astronauts toward the International Space Station (ISS). The mission will focus on critical operations to maintain and upgrade ISS systems, and it will also involve a potential rescue operation for Crew-8 members, who have been stationed there longer than anticipated due to the launch delays.

**Mission Highlights**
Sunita Williams, who has logged over 322 days in space and conducted numerous spacewalks in previous missions, is one of the key figures in this mission. Alongside her will be three other astronauts, representing a diverse and experienced team of spacefarers, including NASA’s Josh Cassada, ESA’s Andreas Mogensen, and JAXA’s Satoshi Furukawa.

The main objectives of Crew-9 include scientific research, maintenance tasks, and supporting the upcoming ISS upgrades. Additionally, Crew-9 will play a vital role in the safe return of Crew-8, whose extended stay aboard the ISS has been met with logistical challenges due to the unforeseen weather-related delays.

**Postponement Due to Hurricane Helene**
The Gulf Coast of Florida bore the brunt of Hurricane Helene earlier this week, prompting NASA officials to err on the side of caution. Hurricane Helene brought with it high-speed winds and flooding, which would have endangered the rocket launch and crew safety had it proceeded as planned on September 26. The hurricane has now moved away from the launch site, allowing for safer conditions.

NASA officials expressed their confidence in tonight’s launch window, emphasizing the importance of weather stability for such high-stakes operations. If successful, the mission will continue to solidify NASA’s partnership with SpaceX as part of its commercial crew program.

**Looking Ahead**
This mission marks another milestone for NASA’s space exploration agenda, with Sunita Williams once again at the forefront of human space exploration. Her experience, coupled with that of her fellow astronauts, promises a smooth operation as Crew-9 embarks on its journey to the ISS.

The Crew-9 launch will be broadcast live on NASA TV and SpaceX’s official streaming platforms. Liftoff is scheduled for tonight at 10:35 p.m. EDT.
