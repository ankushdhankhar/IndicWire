**Karnataka Assembly Passes Resolution Urging NEET Exemption for State Students**

**Bengaluru, July 28, 2024** – Both Houses of the Karnataka Assembly have passed a landmark resolution urging the central government to exempt the state from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical admissions. The resolution also calls for the central government to allow students from states exempted from NEET to seek admission in other states.

The resolution, passed with a majority in both the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council, reflects growing concerns among state lawmakers and educational institutions about the impact of the national medical entrance examination on Karnataka's students. Proponents argue that NEET places students from rural and regional backgrounds at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts from urban areas and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools.

**Key Points of the Resolution:**

1. **NEET Exemption:** The resolution seeks to exempt Karnataka from conducting NEET for medical admissions, allowing the state to revert to its pre-existing entrance examination system.

2. **Interstate Admission Flexibility:** It urges the central government to permit students from non-NEET states to gain admission in medical colleges across the country, ensuring educational opportunities are not restricted by geographical boundaries.

3. **Focus on State Autonomy:** Lawmakers emphasized the need for greater autonomy in determining the admission processes for medical education, tailored to the unique socio-economic context of Karnataka.

**Legislative Support and Debate:**

During the debates, members from various political parties highlighted the challenges faced by students due to the centralized NEET system. Minister for Higher Education, Dr. C.N. Ashwath Narayan, stated, "The NEET system has created undue stress and pressure on our students, particularly those from rural areas. We believe a state-specific examination will better reflect our educational values and standards."

Opposition leaders, while supporting the resolution, called for comprehensive reforms to ensure that any new system would maintain high standards of medical education and accessibility for all segments of society.

**Implications and Next Steps:**

If the central government agrees to the resolution, Karnataka could become the first state to opt out of NEET, setting a precedent for other states with similar concerns. The resolution’s call for interstate admission flexibility could also pave the way for a more inclusive and diversified medical education system in India.

However, the resolution's success hinges on the central government's response. Education experts predict that the move could spark nationwide discussions on the efficacy and fairness of NEET and the potential for states to have more control over their educational systems.

As Karnataka awaits the central government's decision, the state’s educational institutions and students prepare for potential changes to the admission process, hoping for a system that balances merit, accessibility, and regional equity.
