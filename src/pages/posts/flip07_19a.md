### GT World Mall Temporarily Shut Amid Controversy and Tax Evasion

**Bengaluru, July 19, 2024** – In a dramatic turn of events, GT World Mall has been temporarily shut down by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) following a series of controversies, including the alleged denial of entry and insult towards a dhoti-clad farmer, coupled with a significant tax evasion issue.

**Farmer's Entry Denied, Sparks Outrage**

The incident that triggered widespread outrage occurred last week when a farmer, dressed in traditional dhoti attire, was reportedly denied entry into GT World Mall. Eyewitnesses claim that the mall security not only refused entry but also subjected the farmer to derogatory comments. The incident was caught on camera and quickly went viral, leading to public backlash and demands for accountability from various quarters, including farmer associations and political leaders.

**BBMP's Response**

Reacting swiftly to the incident, the BBMP issued a notice to the mall authorities, demanding an explanation for the alleged discriminatory behavior. The authorities emphasized that discrimination based on attire or profession is unacceptable and that the rights of all citizens must be respected equally.

**Trade License Suspended for Tax Evasion**

Amidst the controversy, BBMP officials uncovered that GT World Mall had outstanding property taxes amounting to ₹1.8 crore for the fiscal year 2023-24. Following a thorough review, the BBMP sealed the premises and suspended the mall's trade license, pending the settlement of the unpaid taxes. 

**Official Statements**

BBMP Commissioner Anil Kumar addressed the media, stating, "The actions taken against GT World Mall are twofold. Firstly, we are addressing the grave issue of discrimination against a farmer, which goes against the values of inclusivity and respect. Secondly, the mall's failure to pay property taxes is a serious violation that cannot be overlooked. We are committed to ensuring fairness and legal compliance."

Mall authorities have yet to provide an official response to either the discrimination allegations or the tax evasion charges. However, sources within the mall management indicate that they are preparing to contest the actions taken by the BBMP.

**Public and Political Reactions**

The incident has sparked significant public and political reactions. Various farmer unions have expressed solidarity with the insulted farmer, calling for a boycott of the mall. Prominent political figures have also weighed in, urging the mall management to issue a public apology and urging the BBMP to ensure that justice is served.

**Next Steps**

GT World Mall's fate now hinges on its response to the BBMP's demands. The mall must address the discriminatory incident and settle the unpaid taxes to resume operations. The BBMP has stated that it will closely monitor the situation and take further actions if necessary to uphold legal and ethical standards.

As the situation develops, the focus remains on ensuring that such incidents of discrimination are addressed promptly and that all businesses adhere to their financial obligations to the city.
