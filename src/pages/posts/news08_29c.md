**Delhi Man Stabbed to Death with Kebab Skewers After Altercation Over Delayed Takeaway Order**

**Delhi, August 29, 2024** â€“ A shocking incident in Delhi's Rajouri Garden has left a 29-year-old man dead after he was allegedly assaulted and stabbed with kebab skewers by the owners and staff of an eatery. The altercation reportedly stemmed from a disagreement over a delayed takeaway order.

The victim, identified as Rohit Mehra, had gone to a popular kebab joint in Rajouri Garden on Tuesday night to pick up an order he had placed. According to eyewitnesses, when his order was delayed, an argument ensued between Mehra and the eatery staff. The situation quickly escalated, leading to a physical confrontation.

Reports indicate that during the scuffle, several staff members allegedly thrashed Mehra before one of them grabbed a kebab skewer and stabbed him multiple times. Mehra was left bleeding profusely and collapsed on the spot. Bystanders immediately called for help, and he was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.

The police have since launched an investigation into the incident. Preliminary inquiries suggest that the altercation began over Mehra's frustration with the delay in receiving his order. The police have detained several employees of the eatery for questioning. CCTV footage from the area is being reviewed to gather more evidence and ascertain the sequence of events.

Speaking to the media, Deputy Commissioner of Police (West Delhi), Deepak Purohit, said, "We are thoroughly investigating the matter. The altercation over the delayed order appears to have escalated into a fatal incident. Those responsible will be held accountable."

The incident has sent shockwaves through the local community, with residents expressing their outrage and disbelief over the senseless violence. "This is unimaginable. How can a simple dispute over a delayed order result in such brutality? The culprits must be brought to justice," said a local shopkeeper.

The family of the deceased is devastated and demanding swift justice. "He was a young man with his whole life ahead of him. We want those responsible for his death to be punished severely," said Mehra's father.

As the investigation continues, the tragic event has raised concerns about the rising number of violent incidents in the capital, prompting calls for stricter enforcement of the law to prevent such senseless acts of violence in the future.
