# **Traders' Body Cancels Registrations of Muslim-Owned Shops in Uttarakhand's Dharchula Town**

*New Delhi, March 21, 2024*

In a controversial move that has sparked tensions in Uttarakhand's Dharchula town, the local traders' body has cancelled the registration of **91 shops**, predominantly owned by Muslims. The decision came after a young Muslim man, employed at a barber shop in the town, allegedly eloped with two minor Hindu girls from the area. The incident has raised concerns about communal relations and economic livelihoods.

## **Background and Context**

The incident unfolded when a **barber from Bareilly**, a neighboring town, reportedly enticed two minor Hindu girls and took them away. The girls' disappearance led to an uproar in the community, with locals expressing outrage and concern for their safety. In response, the **Dharchula Vyapar Mandal**, a traders' association, took matters into their own hands.

## **Cancellation of Shop Registrations**

The Vyapar Mandal, after consulting with local authorities, decided to cancel the registrations of **91 shops**. These shops were allegedly operating illegally, as they had not registered with the associationâ€”a mandatory requirement in Uttarakhand. The majority of these shops were owned by Muslims, further exacerbating communal tensions.

Mahesh Gabrayal, the general secretary of the Vyapar Mandal, defended the decision, stating that the cancellation was necessary to maintain law and order. He asserted that many of these shopkeepers had been **"luring our daughters"**, implying that their presence posed a threat to the safety and morality of the community.

## **Outsiders and Economic Impact**

The controversy extends beyond the immediate incident. The association also decided to cancel the registration of all traders who had come to Dharchula from other states before the year 2000. According to Gabrayal, a total of **175 businessmen** fell into this category, primarily from western Uttar Pradesh. By removing these "outsiders," the association aims to create opportunities for local youths to start businesses and earn a livelihood.

## **Legal Action and Protection Measures**

The police have taken action against the Vyapar Mandal for their forced deregistration of Muslim-owned shops. The traders' union has been accused of labeling these shopkeepers as **"outsiders"** and coercing them to cease operations. The district administration, led by Pithoragarh district magistrate Reena Joshi, has registered an FIR against those responsible for the boycott call. Shopkeepers who complained of harassment are being given protection.

Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami addressed the situation in the Uttarakhand assembly, emphasizing that **no unlawful activity** would be allowed. He assured traders from outside that they would receive full protection while doing business in the town.

## **Appeal for Peace**

Amidst the tensions, local authorities have appealed to the people to maintain peace. Manjit Singh, the sub-divisional magistrate of Dharchula, expressed the need for dialogue with the association leaders to address their concerns. The delicate balance between communal harmony and economic interests remains a challenge for the town.

As the controversy unfolds, the fate of these 91 shops hangs in the balance, and the community grapples with questions of identity, security, and livelihoods.
