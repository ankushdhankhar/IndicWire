**Opposition MPs Protest Outside Parliament, Criticize PM Modi's Remarks on Eve of 18th Lok Sabha** 

*New Delhi, June 24, 2024:*

Opposition Members of Parliament staged a spirited demonstration outside the Parliament House today, brandishing copies of the Indian Constitution and chanting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The protest, led by Congress leaders and supported by other opposition parties, underscored their discontent with the Prime Minister's recent remarks ahead of the commencement of the 18th Lok Sabha session.

Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh lashed out at PM Modi, accusing him of failing to present any new vision for the country and instead resorting to what he termed as a "diversionary tactic." Ramesh criticized the Prime Minister for not acknowledging the significance of the people's mandate and questioned his understanding of its true meaning.

Speaking to reporters amidst the protest, Ramesh stated, "Prime Minister Modi has once again failed to deliver anything substantial. His comments lack depth and do not resonate with the issues that truly matter to the people of India. Instead of addressing real concerns, he chooses to deflect and divert attention."

The demonstration outside Parliament House saw opposition MPs holding up copies of the Indian Constitution, symbolizing their commitment to upholding democratic principles and challenging what they perceive as a lack of accountability from the ruling government.

The opposition's strong reaction comes in response to Prime Minister Modi's recent statements ahead of the Lok Sabha session, where he sought to outline his government's agenda for the upcoming term. However, critics argue that his remarks lacked substance and failed to address pressing issues such as economic reforms, social welfare, and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic aftermath.

As the 18th Lok Sabha prepares to convene, tensions between the ruling party and the opposition appear to be escalating, with both sides gearing up for what promises to be a contentious session. The opposition's protest today serves as a precursor to the anticipated debates and discussions inside the Parliament, highlighting the deepening political divide and contrasting visions for the future direction of the country.

*In conclusion,* while the ruling BJP-led government aims to set the agenda for the new parliamentary session, the opposition remains steadfast in its critique, demanding substantive action and policy clarity from Prime Minister Modi and his administration.

This report encapsulates the essence of the opposition's protest and criticism of Prime Minister Modi's remarks, emphasizing their concerns and setting the stage for the upcoming parliamentary sessions.
