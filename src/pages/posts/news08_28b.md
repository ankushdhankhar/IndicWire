**President Murmu Backs India's Olympic Aspirations, Emphasizes Promotion of Merit in Sports**

**New Delhi, August 28, 2024** — In a significant endorsement of India's growing sporting ambitions, President Droupadi Murmu voiced strong support for hosting the Olympics in the country, highlighting the event's potential to promote merit in sports. Her remarks come just weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his Independence Day speech, expressed confidence in India’s ability to organize the prestigious global event.

Speaking at a national sports conclave in New Delhi, President Murmu stated, "The Olympics should definitely happen in India. Hosting this grand event will not only put India on the global sports map but also reinforce the importance of merit and dedication in the sporting arena. It is an opportunity to showcase our nation’s talent and our commitment to excellence."

### A Vision for Global Sporting Excellence

The President's comments align with the growing sentiment within the Indian government and sporting bodies that the time is ripe for India to bid for the Olympics. Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day address underscored this ambition, with the Prime Minister citing India’s recent successes in international sports as evidence of the country's readiness.

"India has the capability, the infrastructure, and most importantly, the spirit to host the Olympics. It is not just about organizing an event; it is about inspiring the next generation of athletes," PM Modi had remarked.

### Boost to Infrastructure and Sports Development

The potential bid for the Olympics is seen as a catalyst for further development of sports infrastructure across the country. The Indian government has already made significant investments in sporting facilities and athlete training programs, leading to improved performances in global competitions like the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.

Hosting the Olympics would likely accelerate these efforts, ensuring that athletes from across the country have access to world-class training and facilities. This, in turn, could contribute to a more merit-based system in Indian sports, where talent and hard work are the primary criteria for success.

### Challenges and the Road Ahead

However, experts caution that while the idea of hosting the Olympics is exciting, it comes with substantial challenges. The financial cost, logistical complexity, and the need for extensive infrastructure development are significant hurdles. Yet, the government remains optimistic, with plans to collaborate with private sector partners and international experts to overcome these challenges.

President Murmu acknowledged these challenges but stressed that they are not insurmountable. "Every great achievement comes with its challenges. But with determination and collective effort, we can turn this dream into reality," she said.

### Conclusion

As India continues to make strides in various fields, the prospect of hosting the Olympics represents a bold new frontier for the nation. President Murmu's endorsement adds significant weight to the growing movement advocating for an Indian Olympic bid, setting the stage for what could be a transformative moment in the country’s sporting history.
